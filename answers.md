# Should the OCP Have Enforcement Mechanisms Built Into It?

**Question:** Given that the OCP is a policy document, should it have enforcement mechanisms built into it? The analysis says that enforcement is weak.

---

This is a nuanced question where the data reveals something important. Here is what the OCP itself says, what BC law actually requires, and where the analysis lands.

**The short answer is: partially yes, partially no.**

The OCP is transparent about its own limitations. Section D.1.7 states plainly that "most of this Plan is non-regulatory." Under the BC *Local Government Act* (Part 14), an OCP is a statement of objectives and policies — it is not, by design, a regulatory bylaw. It cannot directly restrict what a landowner does with their property. That power belongs to the Land Use Bylaw (zoning), which is a separate instrument. So at a structural level, the criticism that the OCP "lacks enforcement" is partly a feature of what OCPs are in British Columbia, not a defect specific to Salt Spring.

**But the analysis isn't saying the OCP should be a zoning bylaw.** It's identifying three distinct problems:

**1. The OCP has enforcement tools it underuses.**

Development Permit Areas and Heritage Conservation Areas are the two mechanisms where an OCP *can* directly require permits, conditions, and professional assessments before development proceeds. The Salt Spring OCP has 7 DPAs, and some of them (particularly the Village DPA) are well-written and specific. But others are weakened by temporal exemptions (pre-Bylaw 480 assessments remain valid indefinitely), blanket exclusions (farm operations exempt from riparian assessment), and overlapping layers with no priority rules. These are drafting choices, not structural limitations of the OCP format.

**2. The OCP uses weak language where it could use strong language.**

Section D.1.4 defines a hierarchy: "will" means commitment, "should" means guidance, "could" means discretionary. But the qualifier "as resources are available" converts even "will" statements into escape clauses. The data bears this out quantitatively — the modal verb analysis of the 1,202 policy chunks shows "should" appears 750 times versus "will" at 273 and "could" at 146. The plan *chose* advisory language for the vast majority of its policies, including on matters like water supply assessment and climate monitoring where it could have used mandatory language tied to its DPA and bylaw amendment powers.

**3. The OCP defers its own implementation indefinitely.**

Section D.5.1 states that "actual priorities and the level and timing of implementation will be dependent on future discretionary decisions made by successive Local Trust Committees." Section D.8.1 makes monitoring discretionary. No implementation timeline, no resource allocation, no accountability mechanism. Other BC OCPs (Whistler, Bowen Island) include phased implementation schedules with reporting requirements. Salt Spring's doesn't.

**So where does that leave us?** The analysis isn't arguing that the OCP should be something it legally can't be. It's arguing that within the tools BC law gives to an OCP — DPAs, heritage conservation areas, mandatory policy language, implementation programming, monitoring frameworks, and directive integration with the Land Use Bylaw — this particular OCP consistently chose the weakest available option. The enforcement gap isn't inherent to the OCP format. It's a series of drafting decisions that prioritized flexibility over accountability.
