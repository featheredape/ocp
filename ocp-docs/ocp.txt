PART A - OVERALL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
A.1

THE ISLANDS TRUST

In recognition of the unique amenities and environment of the Gulf Islands, the province passed the Islands
Trust Act in 1974 which established the Islands Trust with a mandate, embodied in the “object” of the Islands
Trust:
“The object of the trust is to preserve and protect the trust area and its unique amenities and environment for
the benefit of the residents of the trust area and of British Columbia generally, in cooperation with
municipalities, regional districts, improvement districts, other persons and organizations and the government
of British Columbia.”
The Islands Trust Area encompasses the Gulf Islands and water areas stretching from Denman Island in the
north to the US border in the south, and from the foreshore of Vancouver Island to the Mainland. As part of
the Islands Trust Area, planning for Salt Spring Island must consider and address the unique mandate of the
Islands Trust. The Salt Spring Island Local Trust Area is one of 12 local trust areas and one Island
Municipality within the Islands Trust Area. Each Local Trust Committee has been provided with most of the
land use planning authority of a regional district board.

A.2

THE SALT SPRING ISLAND OFFICIAL COMMUNITY PLAN

A.2.1

This Official Community Plan provides a community vision for Salt Spring Island and defines the
land use objectives, policies and actions that could achieve this vision. It acts as a guide for
future decisions of the Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee (“the Local Trust Committee”),
community members, other levels of government and service providers.

A.2.2

The Plan explains the way in which the Islands Trust Policy Statement can be put into effect on
Salt Spring Island.
Note:

A.3

As a plan created under both the Islands Trust Act and Local Government Act this Plan
must be and is guided by that Statement.

VISION

We live in a place of extraordinary beauty, great environmental significance, and rare biological diversity. We
appreciate and accept our responsibility to be the stewards of our island home, to honour its past, care for its
present, and protect its future. We know that it is more important to leave a legacy than to leave an impact.
We also respect our island’s human heritage – the First Nations peoples who lived in harmony with the land
and sea, and whose traditional territory we inhabit, and the early Hawaiian, black and Japanese pioneers who
landed on these shores with little more than their cultures and their determination and turned them into a way
of life. And we acknowledge the old island families, with their diverse origins, whose generations have served
our community and moulded past into present.
Today, we know that our island and its people face many challenges. Some of these are global, such as
climate change and diminishing fossil fuel supplies, both of which pose particular problems for island
communities. Others are more local, like our aging population and the loss of socioeconomic diversity. The
availability of housing to meet a wide variety of needs, and the supply of safe, potable water are also issues
that must be addressed. There are many others.
With our Official Community Plan, we lay out a vision focussed on a set of objectives and based on a
commitment to honour the natural integrity of the island, while striving to meet the basic needs of its
inhabitants. We commit ourselves to leave the next generation with an environment and with opportunities at
least as secure as those that we ourselves have enjoyed.
Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

October 2022

We understand that social and economic development must be in harmony with our mandate. We accept that
there are limits to growth, limits to resources, and limits to the ability of our environment to absorb continued
development. We recognize human impacts and understand that healthy societies depend on healthy
ecosystems, and we will work to minimize our impacts and restore the land. Our need to protect the land
must also ensure its agricultural future, not only because agriculture is a traditional way of island life, but also
because in a changing world it is imperative that we enhance the security of our supply of food.
We also look to secure the future of our community, to ensure that it remains rural and resident-centred, with
economic opportunities to support a broad range of people. We appreciate the extraordinary artistic and
creative talents among our residents. And we hope that the children who grow up here will not only find it a
place to remember but will always be proud to call it home.
We are an active, engaged, vibrant community, increasingly confident that through careful planning and the
self-reliance and ingenuity of our population, we can solve many of our own problems. In an age of climate
change and carbon footprints, we must also learn to adapt and tread with small feet.
The Official Community Plan that follows begins with a wide range of community objectives. These are the
overriding principles that give us guidance and direction. As a whole, this Plan offers a vision, charts a
course, and aims high. It is as full of hope and aspiration as it is of limits and restraint. In it there is a path to
follow that can lead us where we want to be.

COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

A.4.1

General Objectives

A.4.1.1

To recognize and protect the fragility and significance of our natural environment as one of our
community's greatest and irreplaceable assets.

A.4.1.2

To recognize and protect our unique nature as an island - a remote place, unconnected to other
land masses, which exists at a smaller scale; a place where boundaries are absolute, resources
are finite, and biophysical and socioeconomic impacts can be concentrated due to containment
and proximity.

A.4.1.3

To retain our island's rural character and peaceful and quiet atmosphere; to guide development
so that it complements the outstanding natural beauty that surrounds us and reflects our unique
community character. To ensure that the predominant feature of Salt Spring Island remains the
natural environment, rather than manmade structures.

A.4.1.4

To adopt the precautionary principle in the decision-making of the Local Trust Committee. The
precautionary principle asserts that, when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or
the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect
relationships are not fully established scientifically. In this context, the essential elements of a
precautionary approach to decision-making include:
a. a duty to take anticipatory action to prevent harm;
b. the right for the community to know complete and accurate information on potential human
health and environmental impacts as best it can be determined;
c. requiring the proponent to supply this information to the public;
d. an obligation to consider alternatives and select the alternative with the least potential impact
on human health and the environment, including the alternative of no change;
e. a duty to consider broader short-term and long-term costs and benefits to the community
when evaluating potential alternatives; and
f. a responsibility to make decisions in a transparent, participatory manner, relying on the best
available information.

A.4.1.5

To identify and protect important components of our island’s heritage, including archaeological
and First Nations cultural sites, whether they are reminders of past or present lifestyles.

A.4.1.6

To work cooperatively with other agencies, groups and the community in achieving the objectives
of this Plan.

A.4.2

Sustainability

A.4.2.1

To recognize the importance of sustainability in all community decisions. To avoid land use
decisions that threaten the integrity or sustainability of natural ecosystems.

A.4.2.2

To maintain and restore the community's natural capital represented by such items as our
agricultural and forest land base, our potable water supplies, and primary value of our natural and
unspoiled rural character.

A.4.2.3

To recognize our local responsibility to contribute to global sustainability, particularly in relation to
mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

A.4.2.4

To recognize that long-term social and economic well being requires living within the limits of
ecological sustainability, which is the maintenance of ecological processes so that the biological
productivity of the Earth endures without dependence on non-renewable resources.

October 2022

A.4.3

Limits to Growth

A.4.3.1

To continue to focus attention on the finite nature of all of our island's resources, especially those
that are drawn from our natural environment.

A.4.3.2

To provide direction for the conservation and stewardship of natural resources, especially our
surface and groundwater supply.

A.4.3.3

To reflect the finite nature of islands by identifying limits to residential, commercial and
institutional growth tailored to the community's land base and ecological carrying capacity.
Special attention should be paid to ensuring that the human use of potable water can be
sustained without negative impact on other values and uses for natural water bodies.

A.4.3.4

To accommodate and direct appropriate development so that its location, appearance and impact
are in harmony with the natural environment, community resources, character and existing land
uses. To ensure that clustered settlements are well designed so that they become and remain
acceptable and compatible with existing development.

A.4.4

Our Sense of Community

A.4.4.1

To ensure that our community continues to function as an authentic, resident-centred community
in the face of internal and external pressures to change and grow; to ensure that growth,
including the growth of tourism, is managed in a way that does not displace or detract from our
community's important function as a home for its residents.

A.4.4.2

To recognize the importance of our island community's traditional sense of cohesiveness, selfreliance and interconnectedness. To enhance and celebrate these values through the support of
community-building events, activities and land uses.

A.4.4.3

To recognize the strength and exceptional value of the community's diverse human population - a
population characterized by people of many ages and backgrounds who, through choice or
circumstance, have a rich variety of lifestyles and livelihoods. To recognize the very real, if
intangible, loss that is felt in the community when this diversity is diminished by external
pressures and changes.

A.4.4.4

To preserve and protect human diversity in our community by ensuring that the island's people
are accommodated by a broad spectrum of appropriate and accessible housing and facilities,
transportation choices, service opportunities and choices of livelihood, with a local focus to
minimize transportation needs.

A.4.4.5

To recognize the importance of broad community consultation, economic security, coordinated
and efficient infrastructure development and established land use policies to the maintenance of a
healthy community.

A.4.4.6

To ensure the continued development of land use opportunities for non-traditional residential
settlement. Opportunities that are based on the communal stewardship of land, conservation of
resources and alternative forms of infrastructure are of special importance.

A.4.4.7

To recognize that development should be managed to protect our sense of community and
maintain our ability to absorb changes.

A.4.4.8

To identify creative and proactive ways through which a diverse, liveable and vibrant community
can be created within the confines of our island's finite land base and resources.

A.4.4.9

To remain an island community without a bridge or tunnel to other land masses.

A.4.5

Community Health and Safety

A.4.5.1

To accommodate the community's need to be safe, secure and healthy - physically, mentally and
spiritually.

A.4.5.2

To encourage multiple modes of healthy, active transportation among residents of all ages, such
as walking and bicycling.

A.4.5.3

To foster improved air quality through strategies to reduce reliance on single-occupancy
automobile use, eliminate idling, and encourage fuel-efficient and zero-pollution vehicles.

A.4.5.4

To designate land for appropriate and accessible social and recreational opportunities for all
residents.

A.4.6

Island Livelihoods and Economies

A.4.6.1

To recognize the important role that varied livelihoods and a vibrant economy play in our
community's unique character.

A.4.6.2

To maintain and encourage a diverse and creative community by providing a wide range of
opportunities and locations for earning a living that are compatible with and can take advantage
of the protection and preservation of the island's beauty and character. In particular, to
encourage small, locally owned businesses whose revenues remain on the island, especially
those which expand local production and consumption to meet the needs of islanders.

A.4.6.3

To encourage living-wage, meaningful, year-round employment and income-generating
opportunities that especially enable young people and families to remain on the island.

A.5.1

OBJECTIVES

A.5.1.1

To recognize the intrinsic value of our ecosystems and that the health of our ecosystems is
inextricably linked to human health.

A.5.1.2

To maintain and improve the quality of the island's natural environment. To give particular
attention to the quality of fresh water to sustain healthy fish and wildlife habitat and for human
supplies.

A.5.1.3

To identify and encourage protection of those parts of the island that are especially sensitive to
development, including those Environmentally Sensitive Areas shown on Maps 9 through 12.

A.5.1.4

To protect areas of high biodiversity. To recognize and protect the island's native plant, animal
and bird life. To give particular attention to the streams, wetlands and shorelines of Salt Spring
Island.

A.5.1.5

To identify and encourage the creation of a network of protected areas that preserve
representative ecosystems.

A.5.1.6

To encourage sustainable land use practices and adopt best management practices.

A.5.1.7

To secure at least 30% of the island land base for conservation. To develop a Community
Greenways system of private and public greenways, some of which may also be associated with
the island's trail network.

A.5.1.8

To integrate the spirit and intent of federal and provincial environmental legislation and the
Agricultural Land Commission Act and the Farm Practices Protection ("Right to Farm") Act into
local environmental policies and bylaws.

A.5.1.9

To support and participate in the implementation of the Regional Green/Blue Spaces Strategy
prepared by the Capital Regional District.

A.5.2

POLICIES

A.5.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will promote public education and the encouragement of private
stewardship to achieve the objectives of this section. The Committee should make information
about the natural environment widely available and continue to provide assistance and
encouragement to those who protect it through mechanisms such as private covenants.

A.5.2.2

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners who wish
to transfer their development potential from areas identified as Environmentally Sensitive Areas
or High Biodiversity Areas on Maps 9 through 12. Additional Environmentally Sensitive Areas or
High Biodiversity Areas could be identified by further study. Such specific areas should be
considered "Development Potential Donor Areas", even if they are in a Designation that is
identified as a Development Potential Receiving Area. Applications should meet the guidelines in
Appendix 4.
Background Note:

A.5.2.3

Transfer of development potential from community water supply watersheds
is also encouraged in Section B.8.1.

The protection of Environmentally Sensitive Areas or High Biodiversity Areas is an eligible
community amenity, which could be exchanged for a higher density of development as outlined in
Appendix 3.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

12

October 2022

A.5.2.4

Maps 9 through 12 are intended to encourage environmental stewardship. These maps show
general areas that could be considered Environmentally Sensitive and High Biodiversity Areas. If
the Local Trust Committee receives a rezoning application to transfer development or to protect
an Environmentally Sensitive Area or a High Biodiversity Area in exchange for additional density,
further study could more clearly identify boundaries.

A.5.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes that would result in more
development or greater impacts on areas identified as Environmentally Sensitive.

A.5.2.6

The Local Trust Committee may work with the Capital Regional District to develop property tax
exemptions as an incentive for the protection of riparian habitat should this be considered
feasible.

A.5.2.7

The Local Trust Committee should continue to enter into agreements with the Trust Fund Board
outlining the ways in which the parties will cooperate and consult about conservation land
acquisitions on Salt Spring Island.

A.5.2.8

The Local Trust Committee will encourage protection of Crown foreshore, wetland, stream and
riparian corridor habitats, other sensitive ecosystems, and wildlife habitat through the
development permit process:
a. The Local Trust Committee will update watercourse mapping and development permit area
designations and guidelines to comply with provincial Riparian Area Regulations.
b. The Local Trust Committee will undertake updated sensitive ecosystem mapping and should
designate sensitive areas as development permit areas for protection of the natural
environment.
c.

The Local Trust Committee will support efforts to map the locations of heron and raptor nests
and will review regulations and standards for a protective buffer. The Local Trust Committee
should designate development permit areas for the protection of sensitive nest trees.

d. The Local Trust Committee will support efforts to map the habitat of threatened or
endangered species and will consider designating development permit areas for the
protection of such habitat.
A.5.2.9

The Local Trust Committee will continue to use Development Permit Area designations for
protection of the natural environment to protect watersheds used for community surface water
supplies or within the capture zone of community water supply wells. Zoning changes should not
be made so that more development would be located in these areas. Development permit area
guidelines should encourage subdivision layouts that avoid impacts on these areas. Stewardship
on the part of property owners and other agencies will also be encouraged.

A.5.2.10

The Local Trust Committee should develop improved methods of determining and assessing
environmental impacts and encouraging protection of the natural environment when it is
processing land use applications and referrals. The Local Trust Committee should obtain
comprehensive development approval information as designated and specified in s. G.1.4.

A.5.2.11

The Local Trust Committee should provide advice and education to the public about
environmental issues and should continue to encourage and promote private stewardship. The
Committee should retain the Environmental Advisory Committee to provide assistance in these
initiatives. The Local Trust Committee should also support and seek advice and input from other
non-governmental organizations which support the Object of the Islands Trust and the objectives
of this Plan.

A.5.2.12

The Local Trust Committee encourages landowners and others to avoid the use of pesticides,
herbicides and fungicides. If used, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides should be applied in a
manner that avoids damage to adjoining lands and drainage areas.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

13

October 2022

A.5.2.13

The Local Trust Committee encourages landowners and others to utilize current best practices
and guidelines in undertaking an ecosystem-based approach to site planning and development.
An example is the guidelines in the manual Develop With Care: Environmental Guidelines for
Urban and Rural Land Development in British Columbia, 2006, prepared by the B.C Ministry of
Environment. Landowners and developers are encouraged to utilize the following principles in
new development:
a. identify environmental values prior to site clearing and design.
b. locate development away from areas with high environmental values, and place natural
buffers between the development site and sensitive features.
c. concentrate development in areas with low environmental values.
d. develop and implement site plans that protect biodiversity, clean air, and clean water.
e. locate developments away from areas that may be subject to erosion, flooding, wildfires, and
wildlife conflicts.
f. locate developments away from areas of agricultural potential and establish buffers between
the development site and farmland.
g. minimize impacts of roads and driveways and reduce fragmentation of habitat.
h. maintain water quality.
i. maintain air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
j. design energy- and water-efficient developments that conserve natural resources.
k. minimize wastes, and manage wastes in an environmentally sound manner.
l. work with the local community to maximize the benefits of good environmental planning at the
community and site level.
The Local Trust Committee should continue to ensure that
these principles are reflected in its regulations and
development permit area guidelines.

A.5.2.14

The Local Trust Committee should retain existing
regulations to control, surface run-off and to manage
stormwater. The LTC should consider adopting regulations
to manage soil removal and deposit in order to protect
productive or sensitive soils, wetlands, environmentally
sensitive areas, and residential neighbourhoods.

A.5.2.15

The Local Trust Committee should develop ways to
encourage sustainable building techniques through support
for implementation of energy efficient building design and
building practices as demonstrated through recognized
building certification programs such as R-2000, BuiltGreen
Platinum, and LEED.

A.5.2.16

The Local Trust Committee should develop policies and
strategies, in cooperation with the Trust Fund Board, to link
the community's parklands, conservation lands and other
open space into a network of protected areas. The
development of community greenways that serve both a
recreational and conservation function should be
encouraged.

GARRY OAK MEADOW artwork: B. Curran

October 2022

A.5.2.17

The Local Trust Committee will recognize the needs of the local farming community, the Farm
Practices Protection ("Right to Farm") Act, the Agricultural Land Commission Act and regulations,
and the recommendations of the Area Farm Plan when developing policies or bylaws about
environmental protection. The Agricultural Advisory Committee and the Ministry of Environment
will be consulted as part of this process to develop mutually acceptable management solutions
which protect sensitive environments but do not prohibit or unreasonably restrict farming.

A.5.2.18

The Local Trust Committee should support efforts to restore and enhance environmentally
sensitive areas and habitat, including the restoration of streams and other watercourses that have
been modified (culverted, ditched, diverted, etc.).

A.5.2.19

When the Local Trust Committee considers rezoning applications, particularly those in the
Ganges Village Area, it should discuss with the Capital Regional District what measures could be
taken, or local infrastructure required, to maximize the potential environmental benefits that might
result from the project, such as the use of reclaimed waste water or waste energy.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives this Section as follows:
A.5.2.20

Members of the local community are encouraged to continue individual actions that protect and
sustain the natural environment and rural character. Protection of Environmentally Sensitive
Areas such as those shown on Maps 9 through 12 is particularly encouraged.

A.5.2.21

Owners and occupiers of property are encouraged to maintain an undisturbed buffer around any
tree that bears the nest of a bald eagle, osprey, peregrine falcon or great blue heron.
Maintenance of an undisturbed buffer between such trees and the sea is also encouraged. The
community is also encouraged to respect seasonal buffers around all native nesting birds. With
the assistance of the Environmental Advisory Committee and other non-governmental
organizations, the Local Trust Committee will distribute information about the appropriate extent
of buffers for different species and during different seasons and will support efforts to map the
location of nest trees.
Background Note:

Under the B.C. Wildlife Act, it is an offence to disturb or destroy the nest of
an eagle, peregrine falcon, gyrfalcon, osprey, heron or burrowing owl, or the
nest of any bird when the nest is occupied by a bird or its egg.

A.5.2.22

Landowners are encouraged to participate in tax incentive programs for the protection of sensitive
parts of the environment.

A.5.2.23

The Capital Regional District is supported in the ongoing development of its regional Green/Blue
Spaces Strategy.

A.5.2.24

The Capital Regional District and other agencies are urged to continue supporting and
encouraging alternate building construction and waste management techniques that conserve
water and energy or sustain the environment.

A.5.2.25

The Local Trust Committee should identify ways of monitoring community sustainability (for
example by identifying "sustainability indicators"). Results could be used when amending this
Plan or other policies and bylaws.

A.5.2.26

Senior levels of government are encouraged to develop policies to protect the island from all
types of petroleum and chemical pollution of ground and surface water and from air pollution from
local and off-island sources.

A.5.2.27

All levels of government and other agencies are encouraged to take stronger action to protect our
parks, roadsides and utility corridors from invasive plant species.

will be achieved by actions resulting from individual and community initiatives, the actions of other
levels of government, technological changes, and changes to land use policies and regulations.
Background Note:

2007 data is provided in the Salt Spring Island Community Energy Strategy
Baseline Report – Second Update, March 2010.

A.6.2

POLICIES

A.6.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will develop improved methods of determining and assessing the
energy efficiency and climate change impacts of proposed development when it is processing
land use applications. The Committee should consider utilizing a Development Approval
Information Bylaw, as authorized in G.1.4, to ensure that consistent information about the energy

NATURAL HAZARD AREAS

A.7.1

OBJECTIVES

A.7.1.1

To identify and guide development away from areas known to have natural hazards, such as
unstable slopes, highly erodible soils, wildfire, or the potential for flooding.

A.7.1.2

To avoid the creation of new flooding hazards or the aggravating of existing flood hazards that
could result from changes to stormwater drainage patterns.

A.7.1.3

To support efforts to educate residents and to coordinate emergency preparedness.

A.7.2

POLICIES

A.7.2.1

Zoning will continue to include the setbacks from water bodies requested by the Ministry of
Environment to protect development from flooding. If applicable, the Committee will ensure that
required setbacks do not conflict with the Code of Agricultural Practice for Waste Management or
the standards for normal farm practices established under the Farm Practices Protection (Right to
Farm) Act. The Local Trust Committee may consider changes to zoning to establish a new
elevation above areas potentially subject to flooding.

A.7.2.2

The Local Trust Committee will continue to require applicants for large new commercial, general
employment or multifamily developments in village areas to ensure their development does not
increase flooding of downslope properties. Such effects will be managed through the
Development Permit process or through Land Use Bylaw regulations.

A.7.2.3

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners who wish
to transfer their development potential from areas identified on Maps 13 and 14 as subject to
natural hazards. Specific areas should be considered "Development Potential Donor Areas",
even if they are in a Designation that is a Development Potential Receiving Area. Applications
should meet the guidelines in Appendix 4. The LTC should consider preparing new mapping of
areas subject to natural hazards and refine “Development Potential Donor Areas.”

A.7.2.4

The Local Trust Committee should not approve applications for rezoning that would increase
development in areas with natural hazards.

A.7.2.5

The Local Trust Committee will support programs to respond to community emergencies and
disasters and will participate in emergency measures planning and related initiatives.

A.7.2.6

The Local Trust Committee will continue to share information it has acquired about natural
hazards with other agencies concerned with land development on Salt Spring Island.

A.7.2.7

The Local Trust Committee will undertake initiatives to update its mapping of areas on Salt Spring
Island that are potentially hazardous to development due to geo-technical conditions and will
consider amendments to development permit area designations and guidelines for the protection
of development from hazardous conditions.

A.7.2.8

ISLAND HERITAGE

A.8.1

OBJECTIVES

A.8.1.1

To encourage protection of the island's archaeological sites and other sites of significance to First
Nations peoples,
Background Note:

Archaeological sites are protected through designation as Provincial heritage
sites or through automatic protection by virtue of being of particular historic
or archaeological value.
Protected archaeological sites may not be
destroyed, excavated, or altered without a permit issued by the Minister (or
designate) responsible for the Heritage Conservation Act. The Act is binding
on government and, in matters of heritage conservation, it takes precedence
over other legislation.

A.8.1.2

To identify and protect buildings, structures, roads, heritage trees, and other features that are part
of the community's cultural heritage.

A.8.2

POLICIES

A.8.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will focus on public education and the encouragement of private
stewardship to achieve the objectives of this section. The Committee should make information
about the island's heritage widely available and provide assistance and encouragement to those
who protect it.

A.8.2.2

The Local Trust Committee may create a Community Heritage Commission to provide community
advice and assistance for protecting the community's heritage.

A.8.2.3

The Local Trust Committee should support efforts to update its Community Heritage Registry to
identify island heritage buildings, heritage trees, and other heritage features that the community
believes are worth conserving.

A.8.2.4

The Local Trust Committee will encourage the designation and protection of eligible heritage sites
under the Heritage Conservation Act.

A.8.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners who wish
to transfer their development potential from land that contains heritage buildings or other heritage
features. Such specific land should be considered a Development Potential Donor Area even if it
is in a Designation that is a Development Potential Receiving Area. Such applications should
meet the guidelines in Appendix 4.

A.8.2.6

The restoration and heritage designation of buildings is an eligible community amenity, which
could be exchanged for a higher density of development as outlined in Appendix 3.

A.8.2.7

An updated inventory of archaeological resources will be supported through:
a. Provision of updated archaeological site location information to the Archaeological Branch.
b. Using archaeological potential mapping to identify areas having significant potential to
contain unrecorded, protected archaeological sites.

A.8.2.8

The Local Trust Committee should support applications to change or vary zoning, setbacks or
parking requirements that would encourage the maintenance or restoration of a heritage
structure, archaeological site, or other First Nations cultural site.

A.8.2.9

When it considers rezoning applications that concern land with a known heritage feature,
archaeological site, or other First Nations cultural site, the Local Trust Committee should ensure
that the heritage features would not be damaged as the result of a zoning change.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

20

October 2022

A.8.2.10

Heritage features in the Ganges Village Core will continue to be protected through the heritage
alteration permit process. The Local Trust Committee could also consider protecting heritage
features, including First Nations archaeological sites or other First Nations cultural sites, in other
parts of the island in this way.

A.8.2.11

The Local Trust Committee should develop a heritage management plan in consultation with
community members to identify other ways to protect the community's heritage.

A.8.2.12

All development applications shall be reviewed for the presence of known and recorded
archaeological sites, and for having significant potential to contain unrecorded archaeological
sites in cases where archaeological potential mapping is available. Applicants will be notified if
the application is within a known, protected archaeological site, or an area with significant
potential to contain an unrecorded, protected archaeological site in cases where archaeological
potential mapping is available. Notification may include direction to engage a professional
consulting archaeologist to determine if an archaeological impact assessment is necessary to
manage development related impacts.
Applicants should modify or revise proposed development plans to avoid archaeological site
impacts as the best means of preserving archaeological resources. Alteration of a protected
archaeological site requires a Provincial Heritage Alteration Permit prior to land altering activities.
The Local Trust Committee will avoid making zoning changes that would result in significant
disturbance to an archaeological site. Should there be unavoidable conflicts with significant
archaeological sites or trails, rezoning should not proceed unless measures are required to
manage the impacts.

A.8.2.13

The Local Trust Committee will continue to work with the Ministry of Transportation and
Infrastructure to identify and develop guidelines for designating and protecting the scenic and
heritage value of island roads. Those sections identified by the community as having particularly
high scenic and heritage values are shown on Map 15.

A.8.2.14

The Local Trust Committee should, in cooperation with First Nations and other agencies, develop
improved methods of determining and assessing impacts on potential archaeological sites, or
other First Nations cultural sites, when it is considering land use applications and referrals. The
Local Trust Committee should obtain comprehensive development approval information as
provided for in s. G.1.4.

A.8.2.15

To increase awareness of First Nations heritage, the Local Trust Committee should support the
use of First Nations place names that have been recognized by all First Nations with interests in
the related area.

A.8.2.16

The permanent formal protection of an archaeological site or other site of significance to First
Nations peoples is an eligible community amenity, which could be exchanged for higher density
of development as outlined in Appendix 3.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
A.8.2.17

The Capital Regional District is urged to consider requests from the Local Trust Committee for
property tax exemptions or other actions requested to protect heritage property.

A.8.2.18

The British Columbia Assessment Authority is asked to assist the local community in protecting
heritage property by applying Section 19 (10) of the Assessment Act to properties listed on the
Community Heritage Registry or identified in Heritage Conservation Area 1.

PART B - LAND USE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
B.1

GENERAL LAND USE OBJECTIVES

A primary purpose of this Part of the Plan is to illustrate the locations of present land uses and show suitable
sites for future land uses. Proposed locations for future land uses are shown in a general way by the Land
Use Designations shown on Map 1. These Land Use Designations largely reflect present land use on the
island. Some existing land uses, such as community and infrastructure uses are illustrated on Maps 2, 3, 6
and 7. Policies for each Land Use Designation are contained in this part of the Plan. They indicate the types
of land uses that could be allowed to take place in each designation by zoning bylaws. They also show the
maximum density of development that could be allowed. The following general objectives have been followed
in establishing the locations and policies for the Land Use Designations. They should also be considered in
making amendments to local land use bylaws. The relationship between the Land Use Designation Map
(Map 1) and zoning maps is illustrated on Diagram 1.

RESIDENTIAL LAND USE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

B.2.1

Housing quantity
Background Note:

There are approximately 5800 residential lots on Salt Spring Island (2007).
While approximately 1300 of these are vacant, local zoning allows for the
construction of a single family dwelling on each of them. Of the existing
residential parcels, many are large enough that they can be further
subdivided under the existing local subdivision bylaw. A few are zoned for
multi-family use.
All told, the number of dwelling units (not including
seasonal cottages and suites) that could be built on Salt Spring Island under
current residential zoning is estimated to be about 8150. The eventual
population of Salt Spring Island that might result from the zoning now in
place is estimated to be a little over 17,000.

B.2.1.1

OBJECTIVES

B.2.1.1.1

To support a mix of housing types in appropriate locations without compromising protection of the
natural environment.

B.2.1.1.2

To develop zoning that allows many different types of housing and accommodates a diverse
population.

B.2.1.1.3

To acknowledge that a framework that limits growth may restrict housing choices as supply is
limited; to respond to the challenge of fostering socioeconomic diversity within such a framework.

B.2.1.2

POLICIES

B.2.1.2.1

Zoning changes should be avoided if they would likely result in a larger island population than is
expected under the development potential zoned in 2008. Exceptions to this policy are to be few
and minor and only to achieve affordable housing and other objectives of this Plan.

B.2.2

Affordable, rental and special needs housing
Note:

Where land is located within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District, any rezoning
proposals that are expected to result in a net increase in water demand must also take
into account the severe restraints on the District's available water supply. Policies in
Section C.3.2.2 must also be considered.

B.2.2.1

OBJECTIVES

B.2.2.1.1

To provide opportunities for the creation of affordable, rental and special needs housing.

B.2.2.1.2

To integrate affordable, rental and special needs housing into appropriate residential areas where
community services are most accessible.

B.2.2.1.3

To provide, through zoning, the opportunity for island seniors to remain in the community,
especially in their own or their families’ homes.

B.2.2.1.4

To recognize the value of maintaining existing manufactured home parks as an important source
of housing within the community.

B.2.2.1.5

To cooperate with senior governments, the Capital Regional District, housing industry, funding
sources and community organisations to provide affordable, rental and special needs housing on
Salt Spring Island.

B.2.2.2

POLICIES

General
B.2.2.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will initiate a Housing Needs Assessment, to be updated regularly
and on the basis of which the Local Trust Committee may establish priorities for consideration of
affordable housing applications.

B.2.2.2.2

The Local Trust Committee, in cooperation with the Capital Regional District and the community,
should work to establish a target level for the percentage of rented and owned affordable housing
units in the total housing stock, based on projected community housing needs.

B.2.2.2.3

All rezoning applications for affordable housing projects should include evidence of:
a. need for the housing.
b. an adequate water supply for potability and for fire protection.
c. means of sewage disposal.
d. energy and water efficient building design.
e. not degrading a sensitive ecosystem.
f. not being sited in an area subject to hazardous conditions.

B.2.2.2.4

The Local Trust Committee may consider amending the Land Use Bylaw to create a new zone for
manufactured home parks.

Amenity Zoning
B.2.2.2.5

Land for affordable housing is an eligible community amenity, which could be exchanged for a
higher density of development as outlined in Appendix 3.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

24

October 2022

Inclusionary Zoning
B.2.2.2.6

When the Local Trust Committee is considering a rezoning application involving a significant
increase in residential density the Local Trust Committee should require that the application
include provision of affordable housing.

B.2.2.2.7

The Local Trust Committee may consider amending zoning to require that on-site staff
accommodation be provided for larger new commercial developments.

B.2.2.2.8

Zoning could be changed to allow small, affordable homes to be located above commercial
buildings in villages. Existing zoning (that only allows two storeys) could be relaxed to allow such
homes to occupy a third storey, provided that impacts on view corridors are taken into account.

B.2.2.2.9

Where a lot has subdivision potential, the Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning
applications that would allow the property owner to build (without subdividing) the same number
of single family dwellings on the lot as could be built after subdivision. Such shared residential
rezoning applications should be consistent with the guidelines in H.2.1 of Appendix 2.

Flexible Housing Units
B.2.2.2.10 In zones where single family dwellings are presently allowed, the Local Trust Committee should
consider changing local zoning to also allow (as an alternative to a single family dwelling), a
flexible unit dwelling that:
a. has a maximum of two storeys, and
b. has a maximum floor area, and
c. could contain between one and three dwelling units, depending on the needs and wishes of
the property owner.
Flexible unit dwellings should only be allowed on lots larger than 1.2 ha or on smaller lots in
village areas. If zoning is changed to allow flexible unit dwellings, design guidelines and zoning
regulations should be developed to ensure the dwellings fit into single-family neighbourhoods.
B.2.2.2.11 If flexible unit dwellings are allowed, they should be allowed in only a few zones on a trial basis to
find out if they do supply needed housing without having a negative effect on neighbouring
properties. Flexible unit dwellings should not be allowed in zones within the Watershed-Islet
Residential Designation unless they are shown not to increase population or sewage generation
over that expected in single family dwellings.
BL488
(07/20)

B.2.2.2.12

Flexible unit dwellings could also be allowed in zones in the General Employment and
Commercial Services Land Use Designation, where a property is primarily used for general
employment and commercial services purposes.

B.2.2.2.13 If flexible unit dwellings are allowed, they should not be converted into separate strata-titled
dwelling units.
Boarding Houses
B.2.2.2.14 Boarding houses, single family dwellings where rooms are available for on-going residential
occupancy, should be allowed to operate as home based businesses in all zones where single
family dwellings are allowed.

October 2022

Secondary Suites
B.2.2.2.15 The Local Trust Committee may give consideration to amending the Land Use Bylaw to allow
secondary suites in dwellings as affordable housing under certain circumstances. Any initiative to
allow suites should address the following criteria:
a.
b.
c.
d.

A maximum of one suite is allowed per dwelling.
The owner occupies either the principal dwelling or the suite.
Suites should only be allowed in areas with an adequate supply of potable water.
Suites should not be allowed in areas that are community water system supply watersheds or
in community well capture zones.
e. New construction of dwellings with suites in areas containing sensitive ecosystems or areas
that are hazardous for development should be managed by development permit.
f. The use of suites will not be for short-term rental, in accordance with the Land Use Bylaw.
g. Regulations should limit suites to 40% of the floor area of the principal dwelling and no more
than 90 m2 of floor area.
h. Building safety and waste disposal issues are addressed through compliance with the B.C.
Building Code and applicable health standards.
i. The Local Trust Committee will consider the use of housing agreements and other measures
to ensure that suites are affordable and to address occupancy.
j. The Local Trust Committee will work with the Capital Regional Housing Corporation on the
administration of housing agreements in order to implement this policy.
k. The Local Trust Committee should coordinate implementation of zoning changes with Capital
Regional District Building Inspection and the Vancouver Island Health Authority.
l. The Local Trust Committee may also consider limits on the numbers and location of
secondary suites to minimize dependency on private automobiles.
m. The Local Trust Committee will make zoning changes incrementally and monitor changes in
order to have the effect of limiting the overall number of suites on the island.
n. The Local Trust Committee will consider an annual registration system in order to remain
informed about the number and location of occupied suites.
Seasonal Cottages
B.2.2.2.16 Seasonal cottages should continue to be allowed wherever they are allowed by current zoning.
The Local Trust Committee may also consider amending the Land Use Bylaw to allow the use of
seasonal cottages as full time affordable rental housing units in certain areas. In order to
encourage housing for families, the Land Use Bylaw may be amended to permit cottages with a
maximum floor area of 90 m 2 on lots 2 hectares or larger in area, while retaining the existing floor
area limits on cottages on lots between 1.2 hectares and 2 hectares in area.
Any amendment to zoning to allow cottages to be used as full time residences should address the
following criteria:
a. Full time residence of cottages should only be allowed in areas with an adequate supply of
potable water.
b. Full time residence of cottages should not be allowed in areas that are community water
system supply watersheds or in community well capture zones.
c. New construction of cottages for full time residence should be not allowed in areas containing
sensitive ecosystems or areas that are hazardous for development.
d. The use of cottages will not be for short-term rental in accordance with the Land Use Bylaw.
e. Building safety and waste disposal issues are addressed through compliance with the B.C.
Building Code and applicable health standards.
f. The Local Trust Committee will consider the use of housing agreements and other measures
to ensure that cottages are affordable and to address occupancy.
g. The Local Trust Committee will work with the Capital Regional Housing Corporation on the
administration of housing agreements in order to implement this policy.
h. The Local Trust Committee should coordinate implementation of zoning changes with Capital
Regional District Building Inspection and the Vancouver Island Health Authority.

k.

The Local Trust Committee may also consider limits on the location of cottages to minimize
dependency on private automobiles.
The Local Trust Committee will make zoning changes incrementally and monitor changes in
order to have the effect of limiting the overall number of full-time units on the island.
The Local Trust Committee will consider an annual registration system in order to remain
informed about the number and location of occupied cottages.

Multi-Family Dwellings
B.2.2.2.17 Applications for strata conversion (strata titling) of existing multi-family dwellings that contain
more than three units should be considered by the Local Trust Committee, especially if such a
conversion is expected to increase the community's supply of affordable owned housing. The
Local Trust Committee should not approve strata conversions that would replace affordable rental
housing with non-affordable owned housing.
B.2.2.2.18 Preference should be given to rezoning applications for multiple-unit affordable housing projects
that:
a. are based on the housing needs of existing residents and are not meant to be mainly
marketed to off-island residents.
b. would provide owned or rental housing, possibly through non-traditional means such as cohousing, cooperative ownership, sweat equity projects or land trusts.
c. would create durable, and water and energy efficient housing.
d. provide walking, transit or cycling links to village services.
e. provide safe walking, transit, or cycling links to a school, if the project is designed for families.
f. include appropriate site and building designs, such as those outlined in Development Permit
Area 1.
g. that are in or near island villages, except where the affordable housing would be linked to and
support farming.
B.2.2.2.19 The Local Trust Committee should consider changing the local zoning that applies to multi-family
zones so that density is guided by floor space ratios as well as units per hectare. Such changes
should be considered to provide more flexibility in the type of dwelling units that can be built.
Background Note:

Currently, multi-family zones may not provide enough flexibility to allow
single storey units to be constructed for seniors or for those needing barrierfree units.

Care Facilities
B.2.2.2.20 Community care facilities will be allowed in zones that permit residential use, as outlined in the
Community Care and Assisted Living Act.
Background Note:

The Community Care and Assisted Living Act ensures that local zoning
bylaws do not prevent Community Care facilities from locating in residential
areas.

B.2.2.2.21 The Local Trust Committee should consider changing local zoning to allow small care cottages to
be temporarily placed alongside single family dwellings to accommodate those who are disabled
or require family care. Temporary suites could also be allowed to serve the same purpose.
Should the Committee amend zoning in this way, it should first have a system in place that will
ensure the suites or cottages will be used as intended. Care cottages should not be permitted on
properties where seasonal cottages or flexible unit dwellings are permitted.

October 2022

B.2.2.2.22 The Local Trust Committee could consider other innovative strategies that would increase the
community's supply of affordable housing, including, but not limited to, consideration of rezoning

Settlement Patterns

B.2.3.1

OBJECTIVES

B.2.3.1.1

To encourage future development to locate away from environmentally sensitive areas,
agricultural and forestry lands, community water supply watersheds, lands with the potential for
surface erosion or slope instability, public lands, tidal waterfront, areas with outstanding natural
beauty and views, or archaeological and historic sites. To ensure buffers are retained on
settlement lands where they adjoin agricultural lands.

B.2.3.1.2

To redirect the island's future pattern of settlement from one of "modest overall density" to one
that includes clusters of development interspersed with large areas of open space, protected
areas, and resource lands. To guide future development into clusters and towards existing or
new villages and hamlets where non-automotive transportation alternatives and appropriate
services are available and most efficiently and affordably provided.

B.2.3.1.3

To create future settlement patterns that reduce dependency on private automobiles and
encourage other forms of transportation such as walking, cycling and public transit.

B.2.3.1.4

To create future settlement patterns that allow for the efficient and affordable delivery of public
services such as road maintenance, utilities, school transportation and emergency response.

B.2.3.1.5

To create future settlement patterns that minimize energy and resource use.

B.2.3.1.6

To promote efficient land use with zoning that accommodates mixed or shared uses where
appropriate and by encouraging joint use of major community developments.

B.2.3.1.7

To identify a variety of ways in which settlement pattern changes may be encouraged and
enabled (for example through the transfer of development potential), instead of the regulatory
removal of the development potential that exists at the time of this Plan's adoption. To ensure that
any higher density areas that are created through the transfer of development potential do not
have a negative impact on the rural character or natural environment of the island.

B.2.3.2

POLICIES

B.2.3.2.1

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners who wish
to effectively transfer their existing development potential from one property to another in a way
that would achieve one or more of the above objectives. Rezoning applications that would
transfer development potential should be consistent with the guidelines in Appendix 4. Land Use
Designations that are designated in this Plan as Development Potential Donor Areas and
Development Potential Receiving Areas are shown on Map 26.

B.2.3.2.2

The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications that would effectively transfer
existing development potential from Development Potential Donor Areas into new hamlets or
villages in the Rural Neighbourhoods Designation. Proposals for new hamlet or village sites
should follow the guidelines in Appendix 4.

B.2.3.2.3

Village containment boundaries for Ganges, Fulford and Channel Ridge Village are identified by
the Village Designations on Map 1. The intent of village containment boundaries is to keep village
development compact, and prevent 'leap frog' development, reduce the need for additional
infrastructure and services, minimize the loss of rural lands, and minimize impacts on sensitive
ecosystems and other environmentally sensitive areas. The Local Trust Committee should not
approve rezoning applications that would allow large new commercial, institutional or multifamily
development outside Village Designations. Exceptions should be made for new village or hamlet
applications, for applications to provide affordable housing, for neighbourhood convenience
stores and for home based businesses as outlined in Section B.3.2. Expansion or extension of
containment boundaries should only be considered where there are no available sites within the
containment boundaries. Any such expansion or extension should incorporate land next to an

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee

existing boundary, lands which do not contain sensitive ecosystems, lands which do not exhibit
geo-technical or other hazards, lands that are along existing transportation routes, and lands
which can provide efficient access to potable water and other services.
B.2.3.2.4

Subdivision applicants will be encouraged to cluster new lots onto that part of their land that has
the best capacity for residential development, and the least value for agriculture, forestry or
environmental protection, or protection of archaeological sites or other First Nations cultural sites.
The Local Trust Committee will develop informational materials for subdivision applicants that
illustrate how they could maintain their development potential while preserving open space (See
example below).

Source: Arendt, 1994

B.2.3.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should support the transfer of development potential from prospective
"water access only" subdivisions.

B.2.3.2.6

The Local Trust Committee may consider changes to zoning regulations, such as lot coverage, in
order to achieve overall settlement pattern objectives and other objectives of this Plan.

(07/20)

Where land is located within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District, any rezoning
proposals that are expected to result in a net increase in water demand must also take
into account the severe restraints on the District's available water supply. Policies in
Section C.3.2.2 must also be considered.

B.2.4.2.1

The areas designated for Residential Neighbourhoods are shown on Map 1.

B.2.4.2.2

Zones within the Residential Neighbourhoods Designation will continue to accommodate the
medium density residential uses and the other compatible land uses allowed in the existing
bylaw. Existing commercial, general employment and multi-family zones will also remain, but
zoning changes should not be made to locate more of these zones on additional lands in this
Designation, with the exception of multiple-family affordable housing projects.

B.2.4.2.3

The minimum size of lots that can be created by subdivision will remain the same as indicated in
the existing Land Use Bylaw. However, the Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning
applications that allow a slightly higher density (smaller minimum average lot sizes) as part of a
proposal that provided a community amenity (see Appendix 3) or as part of a proposal to transfer
development potential (see Policy B.2.3.2.1 and Appendix 4).

B.2.4.2.4

Rezoning applications could be considered to rezone commercial and general employment
property to residential use at a density similar to that allowed on neighbouring properties.

B.2.5

Rural Neighbourhoods Designation

B.2.5.2.2

Zones within the Rural Neighbourhoods Designation will continue to allow medium density
residential development and the other rural uses allowed by existing zoning. Existing commercial
and general employment zones will remain, but exceptionally large new commercial or general
employment developments should not be allowed in this Designation. Existing zones that allow
higher densities, smaller lots and multifamily use will also remain.

B.2.5.2.3

The minimum average size of lots that can be created by subdivision will remain the same as
indicated in the existing Land Use Bylaw that applies to land in the Rural Neighbourhoods
Designation. New zones created in this Designation will not generally have a density that
exceeds 1 lot per 2 ha. However, the Local Trust Committee could make an exception by
allowing a density of 1 lot per 1.2 ha as part of a proposal that provided an eligible community
amenity (see Appendix 3) or as part of a proposal to transfer development potential (see Policy
B.2.3.2.1 and Appendix 4).
Portions of the Rural Neighbourhoods Designation are a
Development Potential Receiving Area.

B.2.5.2.4

Rezoning applications could be considered to rezone commercial and general employment
property to residential use at a density similar to that allowed on neighbouring properties.

B.2.5.2.5

Despite the minimum lot sizes indicated in Policy B.2.5.2.3, the Local Trust Committee could
consider a rezoning application from a property owner to develop a new hamlet or village site in
this Designation, as outlined in Policy B.2.3.2.2 or to allow an affordable family-oriented housing
development as outlined in Policy B.2.2.2.18.

B.2.6

Channel Ridge Residential Designation

B.2.6.1

OBJECTIVES

B.2.6.1.1

To continue to provide for clusters of medium density residential settlement compatible with the
natural environment of the designation.

B.2.6.2

POLICIES

B.2.6.2.1

The area designated as the Channel Ridge Residential Designation is shown on Map 1.

B.2.6.2.2

Zones within the Channel Ridge Residential Designation will continue to allow clusters of medium
density residential developments and the other compatible uses allowed by existing zoning.

B.2.6.2.3

Zoning amendments should not be made to locate large new commercial, general employment,
institutional or multifamily developments in the Channel Ridge Residential Designation.

B.2.6.2.4

Blocks of land that may be used for residential settlement should remain generally as indicated in
the Local Trust Committee's current Land Use Bylaw. The number of new lots that can be
created by subdivision in the Designation should not be increased.

B.2.6.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications that would allow owners of
undeveloped property within the Channel Ridge Residential Designation to transfer their
development potential to more suitable locations within the Designation or to the Channel Ridge
Village Designation. Such applications should follow the guidelines in Appendix 4. The Channel
Ridge Residential Designation is a Development Potential Donor Area. Proposals to transfer
development potential from areas north of the Channel Ridge Village Designation could be
considered if a thorough analysis of the benefits and impacts of any road network changes is
provided.

Tourism - Accommodation and Facilities

B.3.1.1

OBJECTIVES

B.3.1.1.1

To recognize and welcome the economic value to our community of tourism that is compatible
with preserving and protecting the island's natural environment, authentic resident-based sense
of community, and the aesthetic values that attract visitors.

B.3.1.1.2

To allow visitor accommodation to develop in a way that will best retain and distribute the
resulting economic benefits and reduce any negative impacts; to avoid concentrating benefits and
impacts in only a few locations.

B.3.1.1.3

To retain and maximize the economic benefits of tourism to the community.

B.3.1.1.4

To make land use decisions that would encourage tourism in the shoulder and off-seasons and
discourage any significant increase in the peak period.

B.3.1.1.5

To encourage tourism that blends well with the community and complements the rural, peaceful
nature of the island, and to avoid the development of tourist attractions that are unrelated to the
island’s natural environment, social base or cultural heritage.

B.3.1.1.6

To provide for facilities necessary to mitigate the impacts of tourism on the island's natural or
social environment. Examples are: sani-dump facilities for boats or recreational vehicles, and
tour bus parking areas outside Ganges Village Core.

B.3.1.2

POLICIES
Note:

Where land is located within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District, any rezoning
proposals that are expected to result in a net increase in water demand must also take
into account the severe restraints on the District's available water supply. Policies in
Section C.3.2.2 must also be considered.

B.3.1.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will support the development of informational materials and programs
that encourage low-impact tourism on Salt Spring Island.

B.3.1.2.2

Bed and Breakfast operations will continue to be allowed as home based businesses in
residential areas.

B.3.1.2.3

The Local Trust Committee will not support the operation of transient accommodation units in
residential zones unless they are operated as home based businesses.

B.3.1.2.4

The Local Trust Committee could consider applications to rezone properties for Guest House
use, where operations larger than a permitted bed and breakfast are proposed. In considering
such applications, the Committee will evaluate the impacts of the proposal on the local
neighbourhood and the accommodations industry.

B.3.1.2.5

Campgrounds are permitted by zoning in some Agriculture-zoned locations. The Local Trust
Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners wishing to develop small,
low impact campgrounds on larger properties in the following Designations:
Rural Neighbourhoods
Agriculture (subject to approval of the Agricultural Land Commission)
Forestry
Uplands

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee

October 2022

Applications for such a zoning change should demonstrate an adequate water supply,
appropriate sewage disposal capability, and a site plan that would be uncrowded and well
buffered by natural vegetation from neighbouring properties. If the Local Trust Committee
considers such rezoning applications, preference should be given to those where services can be
easily reached by walking, bicycle or public transit. Rezoning applications for the development of
campgrounds meant primarily for large Recreational Vehicles should not be considered.
B.3.1.2.6

The Local Trust Committee should consider an application within the Rural Neighbourhood
Designation to allow hostel accommodation.

B.3.1.2.7

No additional properties on Salt Spring Island should be zoned for resorts, hotels or motels until
the percentage of built units has reached at least 80 per cent of the current (2008) development
potential. Future levels of development around lakes and streams should be restricted if there
would be negative impacts on the supply or quality of freshwater resources.

B.3.1.2.8

To manage the impact of commercial tourist accommodation zones located in residential areas,
the Local Trust Committee could consider retaining zoning to:
a. limit the maximum number of tourist accommodation units in any one operation to 50 units.
b. establish an appropriate total floor area for tourist operations and for the accessory uses
currently allowed in commercial tourism accommodation zones.
c. establish standards for vegetation screening next to residential property.
d. establish density and standards for campgrounds.

B.3.1.2.9

The Local Trust Committee will not consider rezoning applications that would allow the
development of large new destination resorts, large convention centres, water slides, theme
parks, casinos, and mini golf courses.

B.3.1.2.10 The development of time-shared resorts will not be supported.
B.3.1.2.11 The Local Trust Committee should not approve applications to strata-title existing resorts if the
level of neighbourhood impacts is expected to be greater than that of an owner-managed resort.
B.3.1.2.12 The Local Trust Committee should consider changing zoning to allow for mobile marketing on or
near the Long Harbour ferry terminal.
B.3.1.2.13 The Local Trust Committee should consider changing zoning that would assist in the marketing of
local products, whether in public markets or commercial outlets.
Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
B.3.1.2.14 Other levels of government which secure parkland on Salt Spring Island are encouraged to
manage public parkland, particularly campgrounds, in a way that is compatible with the objectives
of this Section.
B.3.1.2.15 The Local Trust Committee should support efforts to create informational material and to brand
the island in a manner consistent with the objectives of this Plan.

B.3.2.2.1

Home based businesses will continue to be allowed in all areas where residential use is permitted
and will be regulated by zoning.

B.3.2.2.2

The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications from owners of larger properties
who wish to operate a home-based industry, such as light manufacturing, assembly, and repair
services. Such industries could occupy more space and employ more people than would
normally be allowed for a home-based business. Should the Committee consider such
applications, it should ensure that this use would be limited to those industries that can operate
compatibly with the quiet rural character of the island, could be well-screened by vegetation and
would not have a significant negative effect on the neighbourhood or the natural environment.
The Committee should also consider a way of guiding the design of sites and buildings used for
home based industries, such as through the Development Permit process.

October 2022

Background Note:

The extraction of minerals is not a use of land that can be regulated or
controlled by local zoning, although the processing of minerals is an
industrial use and is subject to zoning. The Ministry Energy, Mines and
Petroleum Resources has resource management and regulatory
responsibility for the province's mineral and energy resources under the
Mineral Tenure Act, Petroleum and Natural Gas Act, Coal Act and the Mines
Act.
The tenuring of aggregate resources on Crown Lands is the
responsibility of the Integrated Land Management Bureau under the Land
Act. The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources is responsible
for the reclamation, permitting, inspection and safety of sand and gravel
extraction operations. The Ministry commonly consults with the Local Trust
Committee in considering issuing approvals for mining activities and can take
local policies and regulations into account.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
B.3.3.2.15 The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources is urged to consider the unique
provincial interests expressed in the Islands Trust Act in its management and regulatory decisions
regarding mineral resources on Salt Spring Island. The Ministry is further urged to ensure that
the Local Trust Committee is notified of and consulted on any mineral exploration and
development proposals involving surface disturbance on Salt Spring Island and that the Ministry
implements recommendations of the Local Trust Committee to regulate and address impacts.
B.3.3.2.16 The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Ministry of Community
Development are urged to work, in consultation with the Islands Trust and holders of mineral
claims in the Islands Trust Area, to resolve the apparent policy conflicts in the provincial interest
as expressed in the Islands Trust Act and the acts that govern the province's mineral and
petroleum resources. It is recommended that such resolution occur before or as part of the
provincial Environmental Assessment Process or the Work Systems Approval process and before
consideration of approval-in-principle or the issuance of permits and licenses, should any
proposals for mineral development on Salt Spring Island be made. It is recommended that policy
resolution also involve consultation with the Ministry of Environment and Private Managed Forest
Land Council, whose interests would also be affected by mineral development on Salt Spring
Island. Should surface disturbance be allowed before policy resolution, the Ministry is strongly
urged to recognize and apply permit conditions to preserve important parts of the local
environment and protect development from natural hazards.
B.3.3.2.17 Holders of mineral claims on Salt Spring Island are strongly urged to await the policy resolution
recommended in Policy B.3.3.2.15 before making proposals to develop mineral claims on Salt
Spring Island.

The area designated specifically for Health Services is shown on Map 1. Public hospitals and
private medical offices will also continue to be allowed by zoning in other Designations.

B.4.3.2.2

Zones within the Health Services Designation will continue to allow the range of health service
facilities and other uses allowed by current zoning.

B.4.3.2.3

Those wishing to rezone land to create large new health care facilities will be directed to lands in
the Health Services Designation or to adjacent lands.

B.4.3.2.4

The Local Trust Committee should give special attention to land within and surrounding the
Health Services Designation as follows:
a. Land next to the Health Services Designation should not be rezoned for uses that would be
incompatible with the safety and quiet of the hospital area.
b. Rezoning applications for land next to the Health Services Designation should show how
pedestrian routes to health service facilities will be maintained.
c. Rezoning applications for higher density housing within about 0.8 km of the Health Services
Designation should be designed for seniors or those with special needs.

The Local Trust Committee should change local zoning to allow training facilities for emergency
response personnel in appropriate locations.

B.4.4.2.4

The Local Trust Committee will continue to ask emergency response organizations to comment
on emergency access and safety issues when the Committee is considering rezoning
applications and applications for development permits or subdivision.

B.4.4.2.5

The Local Trust Committee will support the development of emergency-only road connections in
the following locations:
- between Don Ore and Charlesworth Roads
- between Wilkie Way and Rainbow Roads
- between Southridge and Sunnyside Roads
- Broadwell through to North End Road
- and other roads where required

B.4.4.2.6

Should the Salt Spring Island Fire District wish to relocate its Ganges Firehall site, the Local Trust
Committee should consider any proposals it might receive that would provide the District with
land the District finds acceptable in exchange for higher density elsewhere, if the proposal results
in the dedication of the Ganges Firehall site for public use. Land provided in this way is an
eligible community amenity, which could be exchanged for a higher density of development as
outlined in Appendix 3.

B.4.4.2.7

When commenting on applications to create or develop water access points, the Local Trust
Committee will ensure that the local fire department is consulted regarding their need for access
and the filling of tankers.

VILLAGE LAND USE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

B.5.1

General Village Land Use Objectives and Policies

B.5.1.1

OBJECTIVES

B.5.1.1.1

To continue to provide an adequate supply of appropriately zoned land in compact pedestrianoriented villages to support the community's larger commercial, institutional and cultural activities
in combination with high and medium density residential use.

B.5.1.1.2

To encourage a modest scale of village development compatible with the rural character of Salt
Spring Island and with the protection of the community's natural and heritage resources.

B.5.1.1.3

To encourage the commercial viability of island villages and to retain traditional village functions.

B.5.1.1.4

To promote mixed uses of village land.

B.5.1.1.5

To avoid the development of commercial strips along roads leading into island villages.

B.5.1.1.6

To ensure that village land uses continue to focus on the requirements and convenience of
residents and that traditional village functions are not displaced.

B.5.1.1.7

To consider the designation of one or more additional hamlets or villages, resulting solely from
the transfer of existing development potential, and providing that the transfer results in the
preservation of large areas of open space or intact resource lands.

B.5.1.1.8

To support multiple modes of travel in and between villages, particularly bicycling, walking and
public transit.

B.5.1.1.9

To support strategies to reduce demand for automobile use within and between the villages.

B.5.1.2

POLICIES

B.5.1.2.1

Village Designations are shown on Map 1. There are three areas: the Ganges Village
Designation, the Fulford Village Designation and the Channel Ridge Village Designation. General
Policies that apply to all Village Designations are outlined in this Section (B.5.1.2). Specific
objectives and policies for each village are outlined in following sections of this Plan.

B.5.1.2.2

Zoning in Village Designations will continue to allow the mix of commercial, institutional, cultural,
and multi-family land uses that are currently allowed. Commercial zoning should be simplified
with fewer zones and a broader range of uses allowed in each. The maximum residential density
allowed on any single property will remain at 37 units per ha. However, where a multifamily
development is comprised of special needs housing or affordable seniors’ supportive housing, the
density of development may exceed 37 units per ha, provided it does not exceed a floor space
ratio of 0.6, a site coverage of 33 percent, a maximum of two storeys and a maximum of 50 units
in any one development.

B.5.1.2.3

To protect the economic vitality of island villages, the Local Trust Committee should not consider
rezoning applications that would result in large new retail stores, restaurants, office complexes
and multi-family developments outside Village Designations. Exceptions are: home-based
businesses and industries, neighbourhood convenience stores, campgrounds, the commercial
uses specifically allowed in other Designations and the potential development of a new village as
outlined in Policy B. 2.3.2.2.

B.5.1.2.4

To retain the traditional function of island villages, the Local Trust Committee should not consider
rezoning applications that would result in the following land uses outside the Village Designations:
post offices, banks and credit unions, liquor stores, and libraries.

BL488
(07/20)

B.5.1.2.5

To retain the compact and pedestrian oriented nature and economic viability of island villages,
the Local Trust Committee should only consider rezoning applications that would create more
commercially-zoned land in Village Designations if the following guidelines are met:
a. the proposed use is compact and not land intensive.
b. existing commercial zones are largely developed to their practical development potential
and there is evidence of a community need for additional commercial land.
c. the proposed rezoning would tend to concentrate development near existing commercial,
general employment, institutional or multi-family land uses.
d. designs and site plans are consistent with the guidelines in Development Permit Area 1.
e. the Local Trust Committee has undertaken a review and inventory of existing
commercially zoned land and development, assessed existing and future projected
demand, and on the basis of this assessment, may consider re-designating and rezoning
land for additional commercial uses.
f.
the proposed development would be barrier free.
g. sidewalks would be provided with any new commercial or general employment
development.

BL488
(07/20)

B.5.1.2.6

The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications that would result in some
additional general employment uses in Village Designations. However, such uses should not be
land intensive or result in a level of pollution that would be incompatible with commercial and high
density residential development.

B.5.1.2.7

The Local Trust Committee should consider amending local zoning within Village Designations to
be more in keeping with traditional village forms and more appropriate to the small, pedestrian
nature of villages.

B.5.1.2.8

The Local Trust Committee may consider making changes to zoning to allow the creation of livework spaces.

B.5.1.2.9

The Local Trust Committee may consider making changes to zoning to establish maximum floor
area limits on commercial and general employment uses.

BL488
(07/20)

B.5.1.2.10 When considering rezoning applications, the Local Trust Committee should ensure that zoning
boundaries between residential and non-residential uses are primarily created along rear parcel
lines, as opposed to public roads. Non-residential uses should be well screened from residential
uses.
B.5.1.2.11 The Local Trust Committee should retain local zoning in Village Designations that does not permit
drive-in commercial uses.
BL488
(07/20)

B.5.1.2.12

The form and character of commercial, general employment and multi-family development in
Village Designations will be guided through Development Permit guidelines in Part E.

B.5.1.2.13 Preservation of community heritage in villages will be guided through the Heritage Conservation
Area guidelines in Part F.
Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
B.5.1.2.14 The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is urged to develop specific policies for the
development of the sidewalks and roadside walkways, shown on Maps 17 and 18, and bicycling
facilities. The Ministry is further urged, in cooperation with the Salt Spring Island Transportation
Commission, to consider “traffic calming” on the roads in Village Designations.
Background Note:

the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is not presently funded for
the construction or maintenance of sidewalks.

B.5.1.2.15 The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is encouraged to cooperate with the Salt Spring
Island Transportation Commission in a review of speed limits and enforcement policies in or near
the villages, and to consider the licensing of electric vehicles in or near villages where safety
permits.

B.5.2.2

POLICIES

B.5.2.2.1

The Ganges Village Designation is shown on Map 1.
Background Note:

The Ganges Village Designation is made up of the Ganges Village Core subdesignation, the Upper Ganges Village sub-designation, the Education
Designation, the Health Services Designation and part of the Park and
Recreation Designation. Objectives and policies for the Education, Health
Services and Park and Recreation designations are outlined in Sections
B.4.2, B.4.3, and B.7.1 respectively.

Note:

Where land is located within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District, any
rezoning proposals that are expected to result in a net increase in water
demand must also take into account the severe restraints on the District's
available water supply. Policies in Section C.3.2.2 must also be considered.

B.5.2.2.2

Zones within the Ganges Village Designation will continue to allow the wide range of commercial,
general employment, institutional land uses and the various densities of residential development
allowed by existing zoning.

B.5.2.2.3

The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications that would allow the addition of
some affordable and special needs housing in the Ganges Village Designation, as outlined in
Section B.2.2.2.

B.5.2.2.4

The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications to allow a slightly higher density
of residential development than permitted by current zoning as part of a proposal that provided an
eligible community amenity (see Appendix 3) or as part of a proposal to transfer development
potential (see Section B.2.3.2 and Appendix 4). The Ganges Village Designation is a
Development Potential Receiving Area. However, development potential should only be
transferred to the North Salt Spring Waterworks District if the District can establish that any
incremental demand can be met through water conservation or expansion of licensed supply
capacity, or if water is to be supplied from another source.

B.5.2.2.5

The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications to allow a higher percentage of
commercial site coverage or higher floor space ratios as part of a proposal to provide an eligible
community amenity (see Appendix 3).

B.5.2.2.6

When considering rezoning applications in the Ganges Village designation, the Local Trust
Committee will consider the impact that the proposed change would have on the Ganges sewer
treatment plant. The Local Trust Committee should obtain confirmation from the Capital Regional
District of sewage system capacity for any change to zoning within the boundaries of the sewered
area that may result in a significant change in sewage volume or quality. This policy is further
outlined in Section C.4.2.

B.5.2.2.7

The Local Trust Committee will support the development of a Ganges Harbour Management
Plan.

B.5.2.2.8

The Local Trust Committee may consider developing a local area plan for Ganges Village.

B.5.2.2.9

The Local Trust Committee may consider changing zoning to permit some 3-storey buildings in
areas away from the shoreline, the Ganges Village Core and established view corridors.

B.5.2.2.10 The Local Trust Committee will support continued development of the Ganges Public Pathway
System as shown on Map 17 and proposed pathways and trails in the Urban Trails Task Force
Report for Ganges Village.

POLICIES

B.5.3.2.1

The Fulford Village Designation is shown on Map 1.

B.5.3.2.2

Zones within the Fulford Village Designation will continue to allow the commercial and general
employment land uses and the various densities of residential land uses allowed by existing
zoning.

B.5.3.2.3

Should the Local Trust Committee consider rezoning applications to create more commerciallyzoned land on lots where there is an existing residential building, the proposed commercial use
should take place in the existing structure. The existing structure should be maintained to retain
village character.

B.5.3.2.4

To protect the village core area from the disruption caused by ferry commuter parking, the Local
Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications to allow the development of commercial
parking lots. Parking lots should be landscaped and designed to reduce negative impacts on
existing vegetation and the character of the village, as outlined in the applicable development
permit area guidelines.

impact on the marine environment of the Fulford Creek estuary, tidal flows, visual sightlines, or
the inner basin adjacent to the Ferry terminal.
Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
B.5.3.2.14 The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, Capital Regional District, Salt Spring Harbour
Authority, and the B.C. Ferry Services Inc. are urged to help the Fulford Village community
develop solutions to ferry traffic congestion and ferry customer parking. The Local Trust
Committee supports strategies that emphasize improved traffic management on roads and
incentives for non-automotive travel. The B.C. Ferry Services Inc. is encouraged to support the
purchase and development of land for commuter parking, as outlined in Policy B.5.3.2.4. The
Local Trust Committee could support an expansion of the ferry staging area to accommodate a
minimum of one sailing load, provided solutions can be found to any anticipated environmental
impacts. The design of the staging area should minimize the impact on the village's character as
outlined in the applicable development permit area guidelines.
B.5.3.2.15 B.C. Ferries Services Inc. should be requested, in their terminal planning, to consider
construction of a walkway around the perimeter of the terminal parking area.
B.5.3.2.16 The Local Trust Committee should support the construction of a multi-use path along the Fulford
Ganges Road to service adjacent residential and commercial properties and a more extensive
network of pathways, including a link to Drummond Park.
B.5.3.2.17 The Local Trust Committee should support a Weston Lake watershed management plan, a study
of the improvement (or replacement) of the water distribution system and the installation of water

B.6.2.2.9

The minimum average size of lots that can be created by subdivision in the Agriculture and
Watershed-Agriculture Designation will remain the same as permitted by existing zoning. The
Local Trust Committee could consider amending the minimum size of individual lots, if such a
change would benefit local farming or protect agricultural land by allowing clustered development.
Background Note:

The minimum parcel sizes and minimum average parcel sizes outlined in the
Land Use Bylaw apply only when land is:
a.
excluded from the Agricultural Land Reserve, or
b.
approved for subdivision by the Agricultural Land Commission.
An exception to the minimum lot sizes can be made where a home site is
being created for a relative as outlined in Section 946 of the Local
Government Act. Such subdivisions must also be approved by the
Agricultural Land Commission.

B.6.2.2.10 The Local Trust Committee could consider changing zoning to permit the following land uses,
where permitted by the Agricultural Land Reserve Act or regulations, on individual properties in
the Agriculture Designation: small-scale processing and sales of island-grown forest products;
farming schools; farm-based tourist accommodation; waste management facilities. Such uses
should only be allowed where farming capability is minimal and the planned use would not
interfere with land productivity. Preference should be given to proposals that would improve the
viability of an existing farm operation.
B.6.2.2.11 The Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning applications from property owners with
productive agricultural land outside the Agricultural Land Reserve who wish to transfer their
development potential to maintain their farm. Such Land could be considered a Development
Potential Donor Area, despite the development potential transfer status of the Designation it is in.
Such applications should follow the guidelines in Appendix 4.
B.6.2.2.12 The Local Trust Committee could consider rezoning applications to allow higher density in
exchange for community owned farmland or land for community farm product processing or
storage facilities. Such applications should follow the guidelines in Appendix 3. Such land is an
eligible community amenity, which could be exchanged for a higher density of development as
outlined in Appendix 3.
B.6.2.2.13 The Local Trust Committee will support the inclusion of agricultural land within the Agricultural
Land Reserve.
B.6.2.2.14 The Local Trust Committee could support applications to the Agricultural Land Commission to
subdivide land within the Agricultural Land Reserve if:
a. the subdivision results in improved farming capability or production on all proposed lots in a
way that would be impossible without subdivision.
b. the subdivision is to provide a house site up to 0.6 ha in size for an adult relative of the
property owner, as defined by Section 946 of the Local Government Act and the parcel was
held by that owner (or a blood relation) before the adoption of the Agricultural Land
Commission Act on December 21,1972.
c. the subdivision is clearly in the public interest consistent with other objectives of this Plan.
B.6.2.2.15 The Local Trust Committee should only support the use of lands in the Agriculture or WatershedAgriculture Designations for road access to other lands if the proposed road does not interfere
with farming capability.

B.6.2.2.16 The Local Trust Committee could support applications to the Agricultural Land Commission for
non-farm use or exclusion of land within the Agricultural Land Reserve in some situations where
local farming or the greater community would benefit. Support for such applications should only
be considered if the application has been referred to the Agricultural Advisory Committee and
falls into one of the following categories:
a. the proposed non-farm use or exclusion would allow an active farm to diversify and broaden
its income, but not decrease the farming capability of the property.
b. the proposed non-farm use or exclusion is consistent with local zoning or a land use
designation or policy in this Plan, including policies B.3.3.2.10 and B.7.2.2.7.
c. in the instance of a proposed exclusion, the Local Trust Committee may consider an
application that would result in inclusion of existing non-ALR farmland into the ALR.
d. the non-farm use or exclusion of property for essential community services, if the location of
the service is limited by engineering constraints, or by strategic considerations such as those
that determine the best location for an emergency response station, and the proponent has
demonstrated that there is no suitable alternate, non-ALR property.
Background Note:

This policy suggests the types of applications to the Agricultural Land
Commission which could be supported by the Local Trust Committee.
However, the final decision regarding all such applications rests with the
Commission.

B.6.2.2.17 When it considers rezoning applications that are not related to farming, the Local Trust
Committee will ensure the availability of water for farming would not be reduced because of a
zoning change. If a rezoning application would result in an increase in water use, the Local Trust
Committee will ask the Agricultural Advisory Committee for advice about the potential impacts on
farming.
B.6.2.2.18 The Local Trust Committee encourages subdivision layouts that reduce the potential for conflict
with farming. When subdivisions are proposed for land that drains towards agricultural lands, the
staff shall request that the Subdivision Approving Officer consider how changes to natural
drainage patterns could affect agricultural activities. Such applications may be referred to the
Agricultural Advisory Committee for advice and the Advisory Committee's suggestions for the
protection of farming operations will be forwarded to the Subdivision Approving Officer for
consideration.
B.6.2.2.19

When it considers rezoning applications for land that borders or drains into agricultural land, the
Local Trust Committee will ensure that zoning changes are not made in a way that would have a
negative effect on farming. For example, the Committee could require that a vegetation buffer
be maintained on land that is being rezoned next to farm land, if the proposed use could result in
conflicts with a farming operation. The Committee should also ensure that a zoning change
would not result in detrimental changes to natural drainage or pollution of water supplies. The
Agricultural Advisory Committee will be asked for advice about rezoning applications on land
that borders or drains into agricultural land.

BL488
(07/20)

B.6.2.2.20

Zoning changes should not be made to allow large new multi-family, general employment,
institutional or commercial developments in the Agriculture or Watershed-Agriculture
Designation. An exception could be considered for community facilities or limited general
employment zoning that would provide broad benefits to the community and are specifically
mentioned in this Plan.

BL488
(07/20)

B.6.2.2.21 The Local Trust Committee will use the Development Permit process to ensure that development
in higher density areas such as commercial, general employment and multifamily zones remains
buffered from agricultural areas, is designed to reduce conflicts with agriculture, and does not
result in detrimental impacts due to water pollution or changes in the drainage regime.
B.6.2.2.22 The Local Trust Committee will consider impacts on local food security when making land use
decisions.

B.6.2.2.29 The Local Trust Committee will encourage and support efforts by others to promote and sustain
local food security.
B.6.2.2.30 B.C. Parks and other agencies are encouraged to support farming in park lands where this has
been a traditional use of these lands.
B.6.2.2.31 The Local Trust Committee will support efforts to discourage the use of genetically engineered
seeds or plants for locally grown products.
B.6.2.2.32 The Local Trust Committee will support the implementation of the Area Farm Plan by the Salt
Spring Island Agricultural Alliance.
Background Note:

"Where properties are located within the Agricultural Land Reserve, they are
subject to the Agricultural Land Commission Act, Regulations and relevant
Orders pursuant to the Act. The approval of the Agricultural Land
Commission will therefore be required in addition to any authority obtained in
accordance with the policies contained in this Plan or other bylaws governing
land use. Furthermore, policies and bylaws must be consistent with the Act,
failing which they will have no force or effect." - Agricultural Land

C.2.2.2

POLICIES

C.2.2.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will adopt the hierarchy of road standards for Salt Spring Island
shown on Map 3 to identify the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s minimum and
maximum design standards for island roads.
Background Note:

These standards are the same as the ones agreed to by the Islands Trust,
the Local Trust Committee, and Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure
following community consultation in the early 1990's and updated from time
to time.

C.2.2.2.2

The Local Trust Committee will seek a variety of strategies, including agreements with the
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to develop the lowest safe design speeds and road
standards consistent with the island's existing rural character. The Local Trust Committee should
not usually support the development of roads by the Ministry with impacts that significantly
exceed those of existing roads on Salt Spring Island.

C.2.2.2.3

The Local Trust Committee will continue its ongoing contact with the Ministry of Transportation
and Infrastructure regarding road standards, as outlined in its Letter of Agreement. The Local
Trust Committee will also seek to participate in comprehensive road network planning in the
island's less developed areas.

C.2.2.2.4

The Local Trust Committee will seek community advice regarding land transportation issues
through the Salt Spring Island Transportation Commission.

C.2.2.2.5

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and the Salt Spring Island Transportation
Commission should be encouraged to develop a bicycle and pedestrian network to be developed
as part of the Ganges Public Pathway System, the island's public trail system and as part of the
CRD’s Regional Trail Network. This network should consist of off-road trails as well as on-road
bicycle lanes. Roads that should be given priority for the development of bicycle routes are
included on Map 4. All other roads on the island should also be considered bicycle routes,
although lower traffic speeds mean that separate paths may not be required. The construction of
those bicycle lanes that provide a safe route to public schools is identified as a priority in
development of island bicycle paths. Bicycle lanes should be developed in consultation with the
Salt Spring Island Transportation Commission, in coordination with Salt Spring’s overall
transportation strategy.

C.2.2.2.6

The construction of walking and bicycle pathways for transportation or recreation is an eligible
community amenity, which could be exchanged for a higher density of development as outlined in
Appendix 3. If bicycle and walking pathways are constructed in this way, those parts of the
bicycle network and walking pathways that provide safe routes to public schools should be
identified as high priority, and should be developed in consultation with the Salt Spring Island
Transportation Commission, in coordination with Salt Spring Island’s overall transportation
strategy.

C.2.2.2.7

Roads where public transit is currently established are shown on Map 5. These routes are
identified so that other planning policies related to public transit can be applied to specific routes.
Map 5 should be updated and amended as public transit routes change and are expanded in the
future.

C.2.2.2.8

The Local Trust Committee will support a review of the routing of and rationale for the
development of an alternate route (Main Rural standard) around the Ganges Village Core, in
consultation with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and the Salt Spring Island
Transportation Commission. Such a route should only be developed where impacts on parks, the
environment and lands within the Agricultural Land Reserve can be minimized. Zoning
amendments which would increase the area of commercial or general employment development
next to the route should be avoided. An exception could be light industrial or other general
employment develoment near the intersection of Rainbow and Atkins roads.
Background Note: The location of a Ganges Alternate Route within the Agricultural Land
Reserve is not to be construed as having the
endorsement of the Agricultural Land
Commission. The construction, upgrading and
dedication of those portions of this route that
are within the Agricultural Land Reserve may
not proceed without the approval of the
Commission.

C.2.2.2.9

The Local Trust Committee should consider
the North Ganges Transportation Management
Plan and other transportation plans developed
by the Salt Spring Island Transportation
Commission as guiding documents for land
use and transportation planning and
implementation.

C.2.2.2.10 The Local Trust Committee could consider
rezoning applications that would allow higher
density in exchange for the dedication or
construction of a Ganges Alternate Route.
Such applications should follow the guidelines
in Appendix 3.

POTABLE WATER QUANTITY AND SUPPLY OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Background Note:

The objectives and policies in this Section pertain to water quantity only.
Objectives and Policies about water quality are in Part A.

C.3.1.1

GENERAL OBJECTIVE

C.3.1.1.1

To apply the precautionary principle in ensuring that the density and intensity of land use is not
increased in areas which are known to have concerns with the supply of potable water.

C.3.1.1.2

To acknowledge that the surface water supply sources on the island are finite and remain under
Provincial control and that more effective use, management and sharing of the resource should
be encouraged to support present commitments and future desired land use decisions.

C.3.1.2

GENERAL POLICIES

C.3.1.2.1

The Local Trust Committee will continue to support and participate in the Salt Spring Island Water
Council.

C.3.2

Community Water Systems
Background Note:

Map 6 shows the boundaries of the island's community water systems and
their water sources.

C.3.2.1

OBJECTIVES

C.3.2.1.1

To ensure that the potential water demand of development within community water systems does
not exceed the licensed capacity, or the amount of water that can be safely withdrawn from each
system's water source.

C.3.2.1.2

To reduce, delay or avoid the impacts of withdrawing additional water from surface water bodies.

C.3.2.1.3

To ensure that zoning changes in the North Salt Spring Waterworks District do not result in such
a level of development that water cannot be supplied to needed public facilities or would not be
available for firefighting purposes. In particular, to ensure that water remains available for
hospital and school expansion, and affordable housing.

C.3.2.1.4

To encourage a variety of conservation methods in all community water systems

C.3.2.1.5

To ensure that zoning changes within the boundaries of water systems do not result in such a
level of demand on island water sources that agricultural activities cannot obtain water.

Surplus (Deficit) at maximum build-out
Source: North Salt Spring Waterworks District (2008)
Notes:
1.

All NSSWD licences have peak day limits, but only the most recent licences have annual
limits. A 2.0:1 peak day to average day ratio appears appropriate based on the past 5 years
usage adjusted for meter wear and estimated losses from watermain leaks. With current
peak day licenses totalling 1.443 mgd and a 2:1 peak/avg day ratio, the calculated annual
licence limit would be 263 MGY.

2. Current demand is based on very dry summer years (like 2003), the total of customer meters
plus a 5% allowance for customer meter wear, plus a 15% allowance for losses from
watermain leaks.
3. Build-out demand is based on the June 30, 2006 Islands Trust Staff Report build-out
projection for development within NSSWD geographic boundaries permitted with current
zoning. The demand estimate is on the same basis as current demand.
Note:

Within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District (NSSWD), the amount of development expected
under existing zoning is likely to require all of the water available under the NSSWD’s current
water licences. There is no assurance at this time that NSSWD could obtain additional water
licenses. Also, NSSWD completed a supply-demand study in January 2007 and concluded that
with current climate St Mary Lake drawdown may be excessive during future major droughts if all
licensees were withdrawing water at their current licence limits. Climate change is expected to
result in increasing irrigation demand and may result in declining water supply. Service
extensions from NSSWD and Capital Regional District waterworks may increasingly be needed
for supply replacement for north-island areas with failing or polluted groundwater supplies. The
Capital Regional District is now conducting a study of the NSSWD water supply situation.
Therefore, until such time as adequate water supply is assured, the target for zoning changes
within the NSSWD’s boundaries will be to achieve no net increase in water demand. Zoning
proposals within the NSSWD’s boundaries which would lead to an increase in water demand may
be considered, if they also propose other sources of water, conservation strategies, or other
zoning changes that would offset any predicted increase in water demand.

C.3.2.2

POLICIES

C.3.2.2.1

When the Local Trust Committee receives rezoning applications for land inside the boundaries of
a community water system, it will refer the application to the operators of the affected system.
They will be asked if water could be supplied to the proposed new development, considering the
needs of their existing customers and the provision of water for firefighting, and any properties
already zoned for further development. When it considers zoning changes within a community
water system, the Local Trust Committee will also consider the amount and percentage of any
remaining supply capacity that would be used by the proposed new use. The Committee will not
make zoning changes within a community water system if the change would mean water could
not be supplied (under the existing license) to existing customers. It should not normally make
zoning changes if the change would mean water could not also be supplied to vacant or underdeveloped properties already zoned for further development. Should such zoning changes be
proposed, the applicant could be encouraged to suggest other water supplies so that the
application could be considered. Examples are rainwater catchment, groundwater use or a water
conservation program.
The Local Trust Committee could make an exception to the above policy within the North Salt
Spring Waterworks District to allow community facilities or affordable housing projects to proceed.
However such changes should only be made if the Committee is satisfied that the District is likely
to receive a sufficiently larger water license.

C.3.2.2.2

In addition to policy C.3.2.2.1, the Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes within
the North Salt Spring Waterworks District that could mean that water will not be available (under
the District's existing license) for the following projects (in order of priority):
a. essential services such as hospitals and schools needed within the district to serve the
island's projected population.
b. special needs and affordable housing needed by the community.
The Local Trust Committee could make an exception to this policy so that one of the above
projects could proceed before another of higher priority. However, it must be satisfied that the
District will receive a sufficiently larger water license in time to serve the higher priority project
when it is needed.

BL488
(07/20)

C.3.2.2.3

Within the Fulford Waterworks District, the Committee should not make zoning changes that
would mean that water would not be available for affordable housing for seniors, in addition to the
district's existing customers and development already allowed by zoning.

C.3.2.2.4

The Local Trust Committee will support applications by community water systems to increase
their water withdrawal levels to serve the development anticipated by this Plan, provided water
conservation programs are in place, the environmental impacts are addressed and the new
licence would enhance the ability of lakeside farms to obtain irrigation supplies.

C.3.2.2.5

The Local Trust Committee will continue to cooperate with community water system operators to
ensure water supply issues are considered before zoning changes are made. The Committee
should also continue to assist in the development of better estimates of projected water demands
and supply potential. The Committee could consider zoning changes that would limit land uses
with a high water demand. The Committee particularly recognizes that this Plan could critically
affect the North Salt Spring Waterworks District's ability to meet future needs and will cooperate
with the District to address this issue.

C.3.2.2.6

The Local Trust Committee will continue to encourage water conservation through guidelines for
xeriscape landscaping of commercial, general employment and multi-family developments in
island villages.

C.3.2.2.7

The Local Trust Committee will continue to obtain advice about local water supply topics from
advisory bodies and water districts.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

83

October 2022

C.3.2.2.8

The Local Trust Committee will consult, assist and cooperate with water districts in supply and
demand management by providing data and supporting efforts to coordinate activities.

C.3.2.2.9

The Local Trust Committee will continue to provide information to the public about water supply
limits and about ways of conserving water.

C.3.2.2.10 The Local Trust Committee will not support the dedication of water bodies as water supply
reservoirs.
C.3.2.2.11 When the Local Trust Committee receives applications for zoning changes within a water
system's boundaries, and the zoning change would increase the demand for water, the
Committee will consider the impacts on agriculture, as further outlined in Section B.6.2.
Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
C.3.2.2.12 The Local Trust Committee encourages water improvement districts, private water purveyors and
the Capital Regional District to collaborate on strategic planning and management of drinking
water resources, including water conservation and watershed protection, in a manner that
supports the land use objectives of this Plan.
C.3.2.2.13 Because new development will likely be located within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District's
boundaries in the future and will need an affordable water supply, the District is encouraged not
to consider expansion of its service area.
C.3.2.2.14 The Capital Regional District is encouraged to continue its development of sewage treatment
methods that could create a supply of recirculated water for non-potable use and to include water
conservation requirements in the building code.
C.3.2.2.15 All developments and public institutions located within waterworks districts are encouraged to
conserve water and to avoid using potable water to maintain ornamental landscapes that are not
drought-resistant. The use of rainwater catchment systems or recirculated water is particularly
encouraged to reduce demand.
C.3.2.2.16 The NSSWD is encouraged to prepare and implement a long range community water supply
plan.

C.3.3

Private Surface Water and Groundwater Supplies

C.3.3.1

OBJECTIVES

C.3.3.1.1

To avoid zoning changes that result in the depletion of existing wells or springs or water bodies
used as water supplies.

C.3.3.1.2

To preserve known groundwater recharge areas.

C.3.3.2

POLICIES

C.3.3.2.1

To protect groundwater recharge areas, zones in the upland areas of the island will continue to
allow only a low density of development. The Local Trust Committee may consider undertaking or
supporting further analysis of groundwater recharge areas on the island, including the creation of
a groundwater conservation strategy. The transfer of development potential to other parts of the
island will be encouraged.

C.3.3.2.2

When considering rezoning applications, the Local Trust Committee should consider the impacts
of the proposed new use on existing wells, springs, or other water supplies. If the proposed use
is expected to need more water than the uses already allowed on the property, then the
Committee should ask for evidence that wells or other water supplies in the neighbourhood would
not be depleted. The Committee should also consider whether water use would affect agricultural
activities or deplete any springs necessary to maintain fish habitat. Should a zoning change be
proposed where groundwater supplies are not adequate, the applicant could be encouraged to
find other means of supplying water. Rainwater catchment or a water conservation program could
be considered.

C.3.3.2.3

The Local Trust Committee should continue to require proof of adequate potable water supply for
each new lot created by subdivision.

C.3.3.2.4

The Local Trust Committee could establish an advisory group to provide advice regarding local
groundwater topics.

C.3.3.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should not support rezoning applications that depend on the import of
water from off the island.

C.3.3.2.6

The Local Trust Committee should consider working with other agencies and stakeholders to
development a groundwater conservation strategy for Salt Spring Island. The strategy would
combine educational efforts with the creation of demand management measures.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
C.3.3.2.7

The Ministry of Environment – Water Management Division is strongly urged to develop a
groundwater licensing program for individual wells that would protect existing wells from
depletion.

C.3.3.2.8

All users that rely on groundwater are encouraged to conserve water.

WASTE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Background Note:

Map 7 shows the island's existing waste management facilities.

C.4.1

General Waste Management Objectives

C.4.1.1

OBJECTIVES

C.4.1.1.1

To accommodate the facilities and services that provide Salt Spring Island with necessary
collection, processing, treatment, transfer, separation, recycling, reuse or disposal of domestic
solid and liquid wastes generated by the island’s residents and visitors, while minimizing the
impacts on neighbourhoods, community health and the island’s environment, and, where solid
waste is transported off the island for disposal, on the intended receiving environment as well.

C.4.1.1.2

To support the reduction, diversion, reuse and recycling of domestic waste materials generated
by the island on the island.

C.4.1.1.3

To support strategies that promote more integrated management of liquid and solid waste
disposal initiatives and to develop land use policies that support these initiatives where possible.

C.4.2

Liquid Waste Management

C.4.2.1

OBJECTIVES

C.4.2.1.1

To accommodate facilities and services necessary to ensure the island’s liquid waste, whether
from residential or business on-site, community or private sewer system, is collected and treated
on island, while minimizing the impact of the facilities or services on neighbourhoods, community
health and the environment.

C.4.2.1.2

To ensure that zoning changes within the boundaries of any community sewer area do not result
in such a level of development that sewer collection, treatment or disposal capacity of the area is
or will be exceeded when the area is fully developed.

C.4.2.1.3

To encourage the operators of liquid waste systems to consider and implement strategies which
support beneficial reuse of waste energy and waste products, including creating and making
available reclaimed water from wastewater treatment facilities and compost from sewage and
septage sludge.

C.4.2.2

POLICIES - COMMUNITY LIQUID WASTE PROCESSING AND SEWER
SERVICE AREAS

C.4.2.2.1

The Local Trust Committee continues to support the on-island processing and treatment of liquid
waste (septic tank septage and sludge from sewage treatment plants as approved by residents in
the referendum of 1993), at the CRD facility located near Burgoyne Bay, such as the following:
a. Receipt of liquid waste materials pumped from septic tanks and other waste holding tanks,
waste sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, and receiving of screenings and
other waste removed from sanitary sewer systems for purposes of further processing.
b. Receipt and interim storage of green wood necessary for successful composting of waste
solids.
c. Processing of materials received at the site to dewater or concentrate solids, treat and
dispose of liquid after dewatering, compost solids with green wood amendment, or batch
products for further use or transport.
d. Storage and marketing of product materials.

C.4.2.2.2

Should new areas be required for a wastewater treatment plant or associated works, the Local
Trust Committee could support a site selection process that considers the following:

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

86

October 2022

a. Performance criteria for technology proposed, especially as it relates to odour production and
noise.
b. Ability to provide appropriate buffers and visual screening.
c. Siting outside a community water system supply watershed or community well capture zone
or environmentally sensitive area.
d. Suitable access for service vehicles
e. Proximity to existing sewer infrastructure, markets for reclaimed water, waste heat recovery
or other resource recovery.
f. Site not located on good agricultural soils.
g. Minimal impact on the shoreline.
h. Other benefits to the community.
i. Site would be above areas likely to flood due to sea level rise.
C.4.2.2.3

Map 8 shows the area of properties included in the Ganges Sewer Local Service Area. When
making decisions about including properties outside that area (i.e. Map 8), the Ganges Sewer
Local Service Committee and the CRD Board could consider supporting inclusion if a study is
undertaken to identify the capacity required to serve anticipated development potential allowed
under current zoning, and if the proposed inclusion would satisfy one of the following:
a. The parcel has a failed on-site treatment system and repair or replacement to protect the
environment from sewage discharge is not considered possible.
b. The inclusion of the parcel will result in the construction of a density of affordable housing
that would not be possible without community sewer servicing.
c. The inclusion of the parcel is needed to support development of a community facility or will
generate a significant community benefit.
d. The parcel can be provided with a service connection without the need to extend the sewer
system.

C.4.2.2.4

When the Local Trust Committee receives rezoning applications that apply to land within the
Ganges Sewer Local Service Area or the Maliview Estates Sewer Local Service Area, it shall
refer the application to the Capital Regional District. The CRD will advise of any requirements or
conditions of servicing applicable at the time.

C.4.2.2.5

The Local Trust Committee encourages the Capital Regional District to continue to maintain the
highest feasible quality of effluent and to produce and make available reclaimed water for nondomestic use within the Ganges Core to offset demand for potable water from the community
water system.

C.4.2.2.6

When the Local Trust Committee receives rezoning applications that apply to land served by the
Channel Ridge sewage treatment system, the Local Trust Committee will consider the capacity of
the system and the anticipated impacts on the local environment.

C.4.2.2.7

The Local Trust Committee will continue to work with the Capital Regional District to develop
better estimates of projected sewage levels within Sewer Specified Areas.

C.4.2.2.8

The Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes that would result in a type of waste
entering either an on-site disposal system or a community sewer system that could degrade
downstream treatment processes. The Local Trust Committee acknowledges that the quality of
end products such as compost produced from liquid waste treatment or processing depends on
the nature of the materials that are disposed of and enter the waste stream. Rezoning
applications for non-residential uses should be referred to the Capital Regional District for advice
on this topic.

C.4.2.3

POLICIES - LANDS OUTSIDE SEWER SPECIFIED SERVICE AREAS

C.4.2.3.1

When the Local Trust Committee receives rezoning applications for land without community
sewer service, it should ask for evidence that the expected amount of sewage can be treated on
site and effluent disposed of on-site without it reaching the surface of the land, discharging into a
body of water, or contaminating a supply of potable water.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

87

October 2022

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
C.4.2.3.2

The Vancouver Island Health Authority is urged to re-examine its policies for on-site sewage
disposal and to ensure that septic absorption fields are located in a way that will protect potable
water supplies from contamination and eutrophication.

C.4.2.3.3

The Vancouver Island Health Authority is encouraged to consider approving alternative methods
of liquid waste disposal, such as composting toilets, constructed wetlands and reuse of grey
water.

C.4.2.3.4

The Capital Regional District is urged to investigate the need for local service areas for sewers
and sewage treatment in Fulford Village and Vesuvius and where needed, to establish
appropriate facilities. However, the Local Trust Committee should first examine and amend the
zoning in those areas to ensure that sewer service does not result in further development. If the
Local Trust Committee receives an application to rezone or subdivide land within these areas, the
Local Trust Committee will encourage the applicant to investigate, with Capital Regional District,
a community sewer project. The CRD is also encouraged to cooperate with the B.C. Ferry
Services Inc. in the Fulford Village area to develop a shared sewer system.
Background Note:

Existing zoning allows for a higher level of development if a community
sewer service is in place.

C.4.2.3.5

The responsible agencies are asked to help in finding ways to collect and treat liquid wastes from
recreational vehicles and boat pumpouts.

C.4.2.3.6

The Local Trust Committee urges the Capital Regional District and the Vancouver Island Health
Authority to develop a program to monitor, detect and correct failing septic systems, particularly
within environmentally sensitive areas such as community water system supply watersheds and
community well capture zones.

C.4.2.3.7

B.C. Ferry Services Inc. is encouraged to provide sanidump facilities at ferry terminals on
Vancouver Island and the Mainland. It is asked to advise its passengers with recreational
vehicles about the lack of sanidumps on Salt Spring Island.

C.4.2.3.8

The Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee should work with other agencies to develop and
implement an Integrated Storm Water Management Plan, with particular reference to Ganges and
Fulford Villages.

C.4.2.4

POLICIES - MARINAS, BOATS AND HARBOURS

C.4.2.4.1

The Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes for the development or expansion of
boat moorage facilities if the rezoning application does not include a program to manage boat
sewage.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
C.4.2.4.2

C.4.2.4.3

The Local Trust Committee supports the implementation of federal regulations limiting dumping of
sewage from vessel holding tanks. In particular, Ganges and Fulford Harbours should be
designated as areas where pollution from vessel sewage should be prevented
Marina operators in Ganges and Fulford Harbours are asked to encourage good harbour
stewardship with their customers. They are asked to discourage the flushing of boat holding
tanks in confined harbour areas.

C.4.3.1.1

To protect the island's environment from contamination by solid wastes. To accommodate the
facilities and services necessary to provide solid waste collection, receiving, sorting, reduction,
reuse, recycling, marketing and /or transport of waste for disposal to the Regional Solid Waste
Landfill.

C.4.3.1.2

To support the reduction, recycling and reuse of solid waste materials.

C.4.3.2

POLICIES

C.4.3.2.1

The Local Trust Committee supports the transfer of solid wastes to the Hartland Road Landfill
instead of the creation of a landfill site on Salt Spring Island.

C.4.3.2.2

The Local Trust Committee supports the development of a site for waste management that could
accommodate solid waste transfer, separation and processing of green wood waste that can be
used as compost amendment, and separation and processing of other commodities that can be
used beneficially on the island, and receipt of other special waste for disposal to the regional
landfill or other off-island waste processing facility. Any new site would:
a. be located in an area of low or very low density residential use (less than one house per 2
ha).
b. be screened by vegetation to limit the effects of its appearance, noise and smell.
c. be located outside a community water system supply watershed or community well capture
zone, or an environmentally sensitive area.
d. have an access route that does not significantly affect a residential area.
e. not be located on good agricultural soils.

C.4.3.2.3

The Local Trust Committee should retain existing zoning for publicly or privately-operated solid
waste transfer sites. The Local Trust Committee may also consider issuing Temporary
Commercial and Industrial Use Permits for solid waste transfer stations in appropriate locations.

C.4.3.2.4

The Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes to allow the on-island disposal of
hazardous or industrial wastes.

C.4.3.2.5

The Local Trust Committee should not make zoning changes that would result in land uses that
could be expected to generate a disproportionate amount of solid waste.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:

The Local Trust Committee could include guidelines regarding the burial of utility wiring in its
Development Permit Areas.

Others are encouraged to help achieve the objectives of this Section as follows:
C.5.1.2.3

B.C. Transmission Corporation is asked not to increase the current flow in its transmission lines
that cross Salt Spring Island, unless public exposure to electromagnetic fields would not be
increased. The utility is also asked not to develop new high voltage transmission lines in areas
that are designated for medium or high density residential use, health care, child care, schools, or
public assembly buildings.

C.5.1.2.4

Utility companies operating on Salt Spring Island are encouraged to continue to use the best
management practices to control vegetation on utility line rights-of-way. The use of pesticides,
herbicides and fungicides is particularly discouraged in catchment areas for community drinking
water supplies and environmentally sensitive areas.

PART D - ADMINISTRATION
D.1

AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETATION

D.1.1

The Local Trust Committee is given the responsibility and the authority to create and adopt an
Official Community Plan by the Local Government Act and the Islands Trust Act. The Local
Government Act outlines the content and function of Official Community Plans. In reading this
Plan, it is important to note the following points:

D.1.2

This Plan applies to Electoral Area "F", shown on Map 1.

D.1.3

The exact location of symbols or boundaries shown on most maps in this Plan will be legally
defined by land use bylaws enacted over time by the Local Trust Committee. The precise
boundaries of Development Permit Areas and the Heritage Conservation Area are shown on
Maps 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25.

D.1.4

When reading the policies of this Plan, the word "will" is used to show actions that the Local Trust
Committee is committed to, as resources are available, or as circumstances suggest. The word
"should" means that a policy is a guideline that, if followed by the Committee, is expected to
contribute to Plan objectives. The words “can" and "could" suggest actions that are consistent
with this Plan and may be taken by the Local Trust Committee, at its discretion. The term "should
not" suggests actions that are not consistent with this Plan. These actions would require a Plan
amendment to be considered by the Committee.

D.1.5

Any mention of proposed public facilities on private lands is to be considered a broad objective
only.

D.1.6

Where matters are outside the jurisdiction of the Local Trust Committee, this Plan states broad
community objectives. It shows where the Committee may encourage others to take actions that
it believes would contribute to community objectives. This Plan cannot and does not represent a
commitment from other agencies to act according to community objectives.

D.1.7

Most of this Plan is non-regulatory. It is different from zoning or subdivision bylaws that restrict
the actions of individual landowners. Instead, this Plan guides the future land use decisions of
the Local Trust Committee. It provides advice and information to other levels of government and,
in places, encourages them to take specific actions. It can only affect the actions of individuals if
their property is within a Development Permit Area or a Heritage Conservation Area.

D.1.8

The definitions in D.9 apply to the interpretation of this Plan. Where a word is not specifically
defined, then its meaning is the same as is indicated by B.C. legislation or the Oxford Dictionary.

D.1.9

Throughout this Plan, reference is made to the Land Use Bylaw that is in effect at the time of
adoption of the Plan: Salt Spring Island Land Use Bylaw No.355.

D.1.10

British Imperial measurements are referred to in this Plan. Except in Parts E and F, they should
be considered approximate measures that will serve as a general guide for the future
development of more specific land use bylaws.

D.2

SEVERABILITY

D.2.1

If any part of this bylaw is for any reason held to be invalid by the decision of any Court of
competent jurisdiction, the invalid portion shall be severed and the decision that it is invalid shall
not affect the validity of the remainder.

D.3

STRUCTURE AND FORMAT

D.3.1

Parts A, B, and C form the main body of this Plan. They consist of objectives of land use
planning and servicing and the policies expected to achieve those objectives. The policies
suggest the actions that the Local Trust Committee will or could initiate to implement the Plan.
They also suggest the way in which the Committee could respond to land use applications.

D.3.2

Certain parts of the Salt Spring Island Plan Area are designated as Development Permit or
Heritage Conservation Areas. The boundaries of these areas are clearly outlined on Maps 16,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. The objectives and guidelines for Development Permit and
Heritage Conservation Areas are outlined in Parts E and F.

D.3.3

Areas where the Local Trust Committee could consider issuing Temporary Commercial and
Industrial Use Permits and adopting a Development Approval Information Bylaw are identified in
Part G.

D.3.4

Part H contains Appendices that are part of this Plan.

D.4

ADMINISTRATION

D.4.1

The Director of Local Planning Services of the Islands Trust or other officer appointed by the
Local Trust Committee will administer the provisions of this Plan.

D.5

IMPLEMENTATION

D.5.1

It is intended that this Plan will consist not only of objectives, but also of policies for action to
achieve the stated objectives. This Plan clearly outlines how its objectives could be carried out
through changes to land use bylaws, through the decisions that the Local Trust Committee makes
in response to the proposals of others, and by advocating particular actions by others. Actual
priorities and the level and timing of implementation will be dependent on future discretionary
decisions made by successive Local Trust Committees and the resources available to them.

D.5.2

The Local Trust Committee will carry out parts of this Plan upon adoption as follows:
a) Many policies in this Plan suggest how the Local Trust Committee should respond to
applications to amend existing local bylaws (for example, rezoning applications). These
bylaws currently regulate the following items:
i.
ii.

the use and density of use of land, buildings and structures;
the siting, size and dimensions of buildings, structures and uses permitted on the
land;
iii.
the location of uses on the land and within buildings and structures;
iv.
the shape, dimensions and area of parcels of land, including the establishment of
minimum and maximum sizes of all parcels of land that may be created by
subdivision;
v.
off-street parking and loading spaces;
vi.
signs;
vii.
screening;
viii.
flood plain elevations;
ix.
subdivision servicing requirements;
x.
drainage management (specific properties only).
The Local Trust Committee will carry out parts of this Plan by responding to applications for
Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

92

October 2022

zoning changes as suggested by policies of this Plan. It will continue to seek community
advice in such matters through community advisory bodies and through the established
public processes for bylaw amendments.
b) Where land is designated as a Development Permit Area or a Heritage Conservation Area,
(and a proposed development is not exempted), a permit is to be obtained before subdivision,
building construction or land alteration. Development Permits do not change the use or
density that is permitted on a property by the zoning bylaw. They contain development
conditions to achieve the objectives of the Development Permit Area.
If a structure has received a building permit before adoption of this Plan, a Development
Permit or Heritage Alteration Permit is not required to be consistent with Development Permit
Area or Heritage Conservation Area guidelines of this Plan.
The Local Trust Committee will continue to receive public opinion into design aspects of
Development Permit applications through its Advisory Design Panel. The Local Trust
Committee will also consider establishing other community advisory groups to provide advice
during the Development Permit process.
c) This Plan will also be implemented through the existing processes by which the Local Trust
Committee considers applications for Temporary Commercial and Industrial Use Permits,
Development Variance Permits, and Strata Conversions. Policies included in the Plan
provide guidance for the Committee that will be applied to each of these development
application processes.
d) The Local Trust Committee recognizes the presence of the Tsawout reserve on south Salt
Spring Island, and urges continuation of the historical use of the land as a natural preserve.
e) The Local Trust Committee will also implement this Plan through coordinated efforts with
other government agencies, including the review of applications referred to the Committee,
advising other agencies of the policies of this Plan and by developing agreements with
agencies that assist in carrying out local policies.
f)

D.5.3

The Local Trust Committee could carry out some policies of this Plan by continuing to enter
into covenants with willing property owners.

The Local Trust Committee will develop a Plan Implementation Program to suggest how some
parts of this Plan can be carried out over the long term. It will identify the major initiatives
suggested by this Plan, their general priorities, time frames and a preliminary work plan. Actual
priorities and specific time frames will depend on future decisions of successive Local Trust
Committees and the ability to engage local citizens, other government and public agencies, and
staff resources to contribute to these decisions. Some policies of this Plan that can be put in
place over a longer term and that will be included in the Plan Implementation Program are:
a) The creation and continuation of public advisory groups as suggested throughout this Plan,
such as an Agricultural Advisory Committee, an Environmental Advisory Committee and a
Community Heritage Commission. Once formed, these groups will be asked to provide
advice about land use matters such as applications for rezoning, subdivision and
development permits.
b) The development and distribution of informational and educational materials that will assist
the community to make good stewardship decisions.
c) Agreements with other agencies to achieve community objectives.
d) Amendments or additions to existing land use bylaws as suggested throughout the Plan.

D.5.4

Many of the policies in this Plan will need the assistance and support of others to be
implemented. The Local Trust Committee will carry these policies through a variety of

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 1 (Consolidated)

93

October 2022

mechanisms, including entering into formal agreements with other agencies, encouraging
agencies to undertake actions or make decisions that are consistent with the Plan, or by
supporting the actions of individuals and groups within the community that advance the objectives
of the Plan and the Islands Trust. In particular, the Local Trust Committee may consider
supporting and encouraging the development of a strategic plan to coordinate implementation of
the objectives of this Plan with other groups on the island.

D.6

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

D.6.1

Planning needs to be based on an understanding of the natural resources and needs of the
community and is done best when a wealth of information is available. Rather than suggesting
that public funds be used on costly research, it is the responsibility of an applicant to provide the
information necessary to support an application.

D.6.2

In places throughout this Plan there are "background notes", written in italics. Because the
italicised parts are provided for information only, they are not adopted parts of this Plan and could
be updated in the future without amending the Plan itself. More detailed information is available
in a Community Profile prepared near the beginning of the Official Community Plan update in
2006.

D.7

FUTURE AMENDMENTS AND REVIEWS

D.7.1

This Plan can be amended by the Local Trust Committee at its own initiative or in response to an
application from a property owner. Those applying to amend this Plan must submit applications
in the form provided for in the Local Trust Committee's bylaws.

D.7.2

The Local Trust Committee can initiate a review of this Plan any time, as staff and financial
resources are available. Approximately every five years, the Local Trust Committee should
consider whether a community review and update of this Plan is needed.

D.8

MONITORING SUCCESS

D.8.1

The success of any plan depends on many things that cannot be known when the Plan is
developed. External conditions and unexpected events can change the effect that local policies
are expected to have. To monitor this Plan's effectiveness, the Local Trust Committee could
identify several measures or indicators to find out whether community goals are being achieved
by this Plan. If necessary, the Committee should consider amending policies to better reach
community objectives.

A NOTE TO READERS
This is Volume 2 of the Official Community Plan for Salt Spring Island, British Columbia
Volume 2 contains sections that apply only to specific parts of the island. It begins with two Development Permit
Areas (Part E) that apply primarily to development in commercial, industrial and multifamily zones. Development
Permit Area 3 applies to foreshore owned by the Crown, and to some adjacent upland areas. Island lakes,
streams and wetlands, plus a buffer area of adjacent land are covered by Development Permit Area 4.
Development Permit Area 5 applies to the land that drains into wells used by community water supply wells.
Development Permit Area 6 includes land which has been identified as having a high hazard for either slope
instability or soil erosion.
BL488
(07/20)

A Heritage Conservation Area (Part F) applies to specific property in Ganges. Part G identifies those parts of the
island where Temporary Use Permits could be issued. The remaining part of Volume 2 (Part H) is made up of
appendices to the Plan.
Volume 1 is bound separately and contains the main body of the Plan. Part A describes the Vision and Overall
Goals and Objectives, including objectives and policies about the island environment, climate change and energy
efficiency, hazardous lands and community heritage. Part B outlines policies and objectives for Land Use. It
includes a section that corresponds to each of the Land Use Designations on Map 1 (the main land use map of
the Plan). Part C discusses community infrastructure and servicing issues. Part D describes the administration
and implementation of the Plan.

DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AREA 1 - ISLAND VILLAGES

E.1.1

Description of Permit Area and Exemptions

E.1.1.1

Development Permit Area 1 is shown on Map 16 – Development Permit Area 1 – Island Villages. It is
designated according to Section 488(1)(f) of the Local Government Act to establish objectives and guidelines
for the form and character of commercial, industrial or multi-family residential development. It is also
designated according to Section 488(1)(b) to protect development from hazardous conditions that could
result from changes to stormwater drainage. Finally, Development Permit Area 1 is designated according to
Section 488(1)(c) for the protection of farming.
Background Note:

has been included for convenience.

subdivision of land zoned for commercial, general employment or multifamily use.
subdivision of land that adjoins agricultural land or that drains into agricultural land.
new construction or alterations to existing buildings on land zoned for commercial, general
employment or multi-family use if the new development is of a size that must provide off-street
parking (according to local bylaws) or if the new development would change the capacity of an
existing parking lot.
installation of plastic backlit signs, of signs that do not comply with the local sign bylaw, or of signs
that are to be placed more than 5 m above the ground.
development of a parking lot with more than ten spaces for commercial, general employment or
multi-family residential use.
construction of institutional buildings that would create more than 280 m2 of new impervious surface.
Only the guidelines in section E.1.10 apply to such construction.
alteration of the existing drainage regime on properties that adjoin or drain into agricultural land.
removal of vegetation within 7.5 m of agricultural land (excluding the emergency removal of a
hazardous tree).
removal of vegetation within 7.5 m of a lot line that abuts land zoned for residential or commercial
guest accommodation uses (excluding the emergency removal of a hazardous tree).

While guidelines about form and character do not apply to institutional developments, local institutions are
encouraged to consider these guidelines when developing large projects within the Area.
Reasons for this Development Permit Area
The villages of Salt Spring Island function as commercial, social and cultural centres of the community.
Existing zoning means there is considerable potential for these activities to continue to grow in village areas.
Development Permit designation will guide the community's most significant, concentrated and visible new
development so that it is compatible with existing buildings, with the natural environment and with community
objectives for villages.
Zoning within the Area allows a high density of development which is expected to result in the creation of large
new areas of impervious surfaces. In the past, such development has changed natural patterns of stormwater
drainage and resulted in flooding or erosion of downslope properties.
This Development Permit Area is adjacent to land that is within the Agricultural Land Reserve or that has been
traditionally used for agricultural activities. The higher densities of development permitted in this Area could
have negative effects on nearby agricultural activities, if that development is not carefully managed. By paying
attention to the design of development in this Area, the potential for on-going conflicts between agricultural
activities and higher density developments can be minimized.

This Development Permit Area also includes three properties outside of village areas that are currently zoned
for multifamily development. Objectives for the development of these properties are similar to those for village
multifamily zones.
E.1.3

Objectives of this Development Permit Area

E.1.3.1

To encourage the development of attractive, compact villages that harmoniously combines commercial,
residential, cultural and recreational facilities in a way that encourages pedestrians and enhances village
economies.

E.1.3.2

To protect and enhance views of harbours and uplands, and provide pedestrian access to parklands and
shorelines.

E.1.3.3

To encourage creative designs that continue to reflect the diversity and richness of Salt Spring Island. To
avoid design controls that would make island villages appear architecturally sterile or contrived.

E.1.3.4

To ensure that large new village developments are compatible with the natural, rural character of the island.

E.1.3.5

To keep the secure character of villages.

E.1.3.6

To encourage the use of local artisanship and materials.

E.1.3.7

To encourage new multifamily developments to provide for privacy, security, quiet and a sense of
community in keeping with their intended use.

E.1.3.8

To protect property owners from flooding or detrimental changes to stormwater runoff, flow regimes or
quality that can result from the construction of new impervious surfaces on upslope properties.

E.1.3.9

To protect nearby agricultural lands (including their water supplies) and to reduce the potential for conflicts
between agricultural activities and higher density settlement areas.

E.1.4

Guidelines for General Site Design, Building Location and Access
Background Note:

Development Permits that are issued for developments in this Development Permit
Area could contain conditions that are based on the following guidelines. Not all
guidelines will apply to every permit. Permits will not contain conditions that are
unrelated to these guidelines. The conditions on a Development Permit will not
prevent a property from being used as the local zoning bylaw allows.

General Guidelines
BL488
(07/20)

E.1.4.1

All commercial, general employment and multifamily sites should be designed to reduce impacts on
neighbouring properties, on-site residential areas and public places, including the sea. Particular attention
should be paid to locating and screening loading docks, waste containers, propane tanks, air-conditioning
units and other service areas to reduce noise and visual impacts. This guideline is particularly important for
development next to schools and hospitals.

BL488
(07/20)

E.1.4.2

All commercial, general employment and multifamily developments should be designed so that the
obstruction of views from neighbouring properties is minimized.

E.1.4.3

Additions to existing commercial and multifamily buildings should maintain the existing building setbacks
from the street, unless such setbacks are markedly different from the general neighbourhood pattern.

E.1.4.4

Major new commercial, general employment and multi-family developments should include construction of a
sidewalk or walking path on adjacent road rights-of-way. All sidewalks and internal site circulation routes
should ensure barrier-free access.

BL488
(07/20)

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

9

October 2020

Background Note:

Construction of sidewalks or other parts of a development on road rights-of-way
requires the approval of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

E.1.4.5

Site access to commercial and multi-family developments should encourage use by pedestrians and
cyclists. Internal circulation routes for pedestrians and cyclists should be segregated from vehicular routes,
with an emphasis given to pedestrian and cyclist safety over vehicular convenience if necessary. Site plans
of large new developments should show how transit stops could be accommodated in the future. Site
access in Ganges Village should be arranged to coordinate with the Ganges Public Pathway System,
including the seawalk. Potential routes for the system are shown in a conceptual way on Map 17.

E.1.4.6

Commercial developments should provide structures
for the convenient and secure parking and locking of
bicycles, close to and visible from the adjacent streets.
Such structures should not obstruct pedestrian
movement on the site.

E.1.4.7

Where appropriate, buildings in the Ganges Village
Core, Channel Ridge Village Core and in Fulford
Harbour should be connected with arbours, courtyards
and pathways to make them inviting to pedestrians.
Along pedestrian routes, attractive public seating and
resting areas should be incorporated into project
designs.

E.1.4.8

Where possible, buildings should be sited and
designed in a way that maximizes solar gain and
reduces energy loss. Obstruction of solar gain on
surrounding properties should be minimized.

Guidelines for specific village locations and situations
E.1.4.9

To ensure a compact and pedestrian-oriented
commercial area in village cores, new commercial
developments in the Ganges Village Core, the Channel
Ridge Village Core and in Fulford Harbour Village
should ideally be located with no or little setback from
the front property line.
Minor variations could be
included to provide small public spaces and pedestrian
amenities along the streetfront. Exceptions to this
guideline could be considered:

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

10

October 2020

a.

On Hereford Avenue in Ganges where greater setbacks could reflect the location of existing
structures. Building setbacks along Hereford Avenue should show a transition between new and old
structures that enhances pedestrian use, and includes public space and amenities.

b.

On waterfront properties in the Ganges Village Core and in Fulford Harbour Village, where
developments should be oriented towards the harbours and parking should be located upland of the
principal use on the property.

Background Note:

Building construction within 4.5 m of a public road right of way will require the approval
of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

E.1.4.10 Where commercial developments have street frontage in the Ganges Village Core, Channel Ridge Village
Core and Fulford Harbour Village, the main floor should be preferably occupied by retail stores, restaurants,
and personal service uses in order to maintain the interesting and lively commercial character of the
villages. Most new business and professional offices and residential units should ideally be located on the
upper levels of commercial developments or on a side of the building without street frontage. Access for the
disabled to upper levels should be considered.
E.1.4.11 To avoid the appearance of strip development along Lower Ganges Road in Ganges Village, new
developments with frontage on Lower Ganges Road north of Upper Ganges Road should be setback 7.6 m
from Lower Ganges Road and should maintain an effective vegetation screen between structures or parking
lots and the road, with minor breaks for access only. Where no other frontage exists, buildings should be
oriented inward around a central court. Where a secondary frontage exists with access to Lower Ganges
Road, building access should be from the secondary frontage, and building orientation should be either
inward or oriented to the secondary frontage. Where commercial parcels lie between Lower Ganges Road
and a residential street, all access should be developed from Lower Ganges Road, to buffer the residential
area from commercial traffic.
Additions to existing commercial development along Lower Ganges Road should use special creative
efforts to avoid continuance of the existing "strip mall" appearance. Parking and shop fronts should be
screened from Lower Ganges Road with generous landscaping buffers and islands. Use of designs that
face the interior of the parcel with an inner court and using scales of traditional village streetscapes should
be considered.
E.1.4.12 New commercial and multi-family developments along Upper Ganges Road in the Ganges Village Core,
along Fulford-Ganges Road in Fulford Harbour Village and along roads entering Channel Ridge Village
should enhance the entry into these villages. Parking should be screened by vegetation or structures so
that it is not visible from those entering the villages. Care should be taken that buildings in these areas
create a sense of entry and do not present an unattractive appearance to those entering the villages.
E.1.4.13 Developments along the boundary between the Upper Ganges Village and Ganges Village Core
subdesignations should encourage pedestrian linkages between these two areas.
E.1.4.14 Developments in Channel Ridge Village and Fulford Harbour Village should include landscaping
arrangements that contribute to a comprehensive pathway system similar to the Ganges Public Pathway
System. Development in the Channel Ridge Village Core should be focussed on a central village green
linked to the pathway system. Recommended walkways for Fulford Harbour Village are shown on Map 18.
E.1.4.15 Development along Ganges and Fulford Harbours should be oriented towards village harbours. In Ganges,
it should incorporate the seawalk portion of the Ganges Public Pathway System as an integral part of its
design (consistent with the plan shown on Map 17). Windows, doorways, patios, decks and pathways
should be positioned to overlook and provide for pedestrian access to the harbour and seawalk.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

October 2020

E.1.4.16 All development in the Ganges Village and Fulford Harbour Village Designations should be located so as not
to interfere with existing harbour views from public areas and roadways. Particularly important harbour
views to be preserved in Ganges include those from Upper and Lower Ganges Roads, the foot of Park
Drive, Rainbow Road and Fulford-Ganges Road, Centennial Park and Gasoline Alley. Views to be
preserved in Fulford Harbour include those from Fulford-Ganges Road and from Beaver Point Road.
E.1.4.17 Developments next to Ganges and Fulford Harbours should be massed in a way that allows sea view
corridors to remain between parts of buildings. Development of Channel Ridge Village should maximize
views of Stuart Channel. Consideration should be given to designs that dramatize the view by framing, or
that use transparent features such as lattice work, breezeways and colonnades to retain the sea view.
BL488
(07/20)

E.1.4.18

Developments adjoining agricultural land should be designed to minimize conflicts with that land. The
location of access roads, the siting of structures, and the layout of subdivisions should follow the guidelines
that have been developed by the BC Ministry of Agriculture and the Agriculture Land Commission as a
guide to implementing the Farm Practices Protection (Right to Farm) Act (MAFF, 1996), including the Guide
to Edge Planning (2015). Site designs should allow for a vegetated buffer, as outlined in Guidelines for
Landscaping and Parking Surfaces Subsection E.1.7.22.

BL488
(07/20)

E.1.4.19

Where the subject property adjoins agricultural land, building setbacks for general employment and
commercial uses should be at least 15 metres from the property line, to be consistent with the Guide to
Edge Planning (2015), developed by the BC Ministry of Agriculture.
Guidelines for multi-family developments

E.1.4.20 Developments should have staggered or recessed entrances that allow for privacy. Clusters of duplexes are
preferable, so that each dwelling unit has more than a front and rear view from the interior. Clusters should
use asymmetrical designs to avoid the appearance of "row housing" or "mirror image" units.
E.1.4.21 On through streets, the building setback required by local bylaws should be maintained so that a buffer
remains for homes. On non-through streets, a variance of the setback could be requested (e.g. to 3 to 4.5
m), to encourage human activity and create a lively, occupied character to the street.
E.1.4.22 Where developments are designed for families or seniors, all units should have direct access from the
ground level. However, developments that provide special needs housing or affordable seniors’ supportive
housing may consist of two-storey complexes, if all dwelling units for seniors and those with special needs
have ground level access or can be accessed by elevators.”
E.1.4.23 Space should be provided for private and common storage and for a convenient mail kiosk.
E.1.4.24 Developments that are to be strata-titled should show the way that their required parkland dedication will be
incorporated into the site design.
E.1.4.25 Internal circulation routes should integrate dwelling units with common open space and play areas and with
public walkways such as the Ganges Public Pathway System. Particular attention should be paid to the
development or maintenance of safe and effective pathways between multifamily developments and
schools, public institutions and village services.
E.1.4.26 Developments that provide special needs housing or seniors’ supportive housing should incorporate
appropriate design elements such as those outlined in Appendix B – Supportive Housing Design
Considerations, of the document entitled “Supportive Housing for Seniors, A Policy and Bylaw Guide”,
prepared by the B.C. Ministry of Community Development in July, 1999. Where necessary to accommodate
such design elements, other design guidelines of this Development Permit Area may be relaxed or varied by
the Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee.

E.1.5

Guidelines for Offstreet Parking Lot Location and Design
Background Note:

All parking lot access and egress points, including those for offsite parking lots, must
be approved by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

E.1.5.1

The preferred location for a parking lot is behind the building it serves, so that the lot cannot be seen from
the main street on which the building is located. If parking behind a building is not possible, streetfront
parking lots should be designed with a maximum street frontage of 10 m and an effective landscape screen.
Developments on Ganges or Fulford Harbours should be considered as exceptions to this general guideline
so that buildings (rather than parking lots) are located immediately next to the harbour. In these situations,
parking lots would have street frontage but should be well screened from the street and incorporate effective
and attractive facilities for pedestrians to access the harbour.

E.1.5.2

To avoid an urban or "strip mall" appearance in island villages, parking lots should not be located on a
corner lot or between a building and the
adjacent sidewalks.

E.1.5.3

Parking lot access lanes should be located and
designed to reduce breaks along the street wall
and to reduce accesses that cross sidewalks.
Entrances from secondary frontages or from
rear lanes are preferred. Parking lots should
hold all vehicular manoeuvring requirements for
entry and exit to and from individual parking
spaces.

E.1.5.4

Offstreet parking spaces should not be located
so that cars must exit or manoeuvre by backing
over a sidewalk or other pedestrian route.

E.1.5.5

In Ganges, between Jackson Avenue and
Lower Ganges Road, new developments
proposed along the north side of McPhillips
Avenue, both sides of Hereford Avenue and the
south side of Rainbow Road should allow for the development of a rear lane way (where topography
permits) that provides access to parking lots in the rear and minimizes access breaks along the streets.
The lane way should be about 7.5 m in width and should be landscaped and paved to make it an attractive
pedestrian route. Consideration could be given to using arcades, hidden courts or other architectural
features that would encourage development of secondary retail frontage along the lane.

E.1.5.6

Parking spaces for the disabled should be plentiful, prominently marked and carefully located for maximum
convenience and proximity to accessible building entrances and weather protection features. If necessary,
exceptions to the guidelines for parking location may be made to maximize convenience for the disabled.

E.1.5.7

Part of the parking required for commercial developments could be located in a parking lot on another
property, provided the following conditions are met besides the ones listed above:
a.

The offsite parking lot is within a convenient walking distance (up to about a half a kilometre) of an
entrance to the building it serves. Larger parking lots in the Ganges Village Core should be located to
the west of Jackson Avenue.

b.

Offsite parking lots for commercial uses are to be located on properties that are immediately next to
the commercial use or on more distant properties zoned for non-residential use.

c.

Offsite parking lots must be exclusively dedicated and secured with a legal agreement that is in place
before issuance of a building permit and continues for the life of the building served.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

13

October 2020

d.

Parking spaces for the disabled are not to be located offsite.

e.

Signs showing the location of offsite parking should be clearly visible from streets next to the building
being served. Such signs may not be necessary if the offsite parking lot is to be used primarily by
tenant employees as a condition of lease.

E.1.5.8

Parking lots should not generally consist of more than thirty spaces, unless a considerable amount on midlot landscaping is incorporated into the design. Parking lots in the existing commercial part of Fulford
Harbour Village should not generally consist of more than fifteen spaces. Where development requires
more spaces, parking should be located in discontinuous areas or be separated by generous landscaping.

E.1.5.9

Parking should only be at ground level or below.

E.1.5.10 Areas should be provided for the loading and unloading of trucks. Sites should allow delivery trucks to
manoeuvre without having to block or back onto an adjacent street, parking aisle or pedestrian route.
Emergency vehicles should be able reach all parts of the development easily.
E.1.5.11 Multi-family developments should provide parking in locations that minimize walking distances for residents.
However, designs where the front elevation of units is dominated by a garage door or parking pad should
be avoided. Parking areas located along the front elevation of units should be well screened by vegetation.
Parking for visitors should be located close to project entries and should be assigned and marked as visitor
parking. Screened parking should be provided for the storage of recreational vehicles and boats.
E.1.6

Guidelines for Building Form
HEIGHT

E.1.6.1

Building height should be in keeping with local bylaws and neighbouring structures. If a third storey is
allowed by zoning for residential use, it should be located as a half storey. In such a situation, a building
height variance up to 10.6 m could be requested, provided other design aspects work to reduce the
apparent mass of the structure.
SCALE, MASSING and MODULATION

E.1.6.2

Horizontal building modulation and articulated facades should be used to reduce the apparent mass of
buildings facing the street. They should create a pedestrian scale and interest along adjacent sidewalks and
along the Ganges Public Pathway System. To enhance village vitality, consideration should also be given to
creating secondary retail frontage along arcades and at the rear of buildings. These ideas should especially
be considered where buildings are next to the Ganges Public Pathway System.

E.1.6.3

On slopes, horizontal modulation (stepped structures) should be used so the building conforms to the site.

E.1.6.4

Existing site topography and landscape should not be significantly altered and should be complemented by
proposed structures.

E.1.6.5

Development next to Ganges and Fulford Harbours should be designed to conform to rather than conceal
the natural contours of the harbour. Where zoning allows structures to extend over the water surface, the
maximum height should not exceed 7.6 m above sea level at the natural boundary of the sea.

E.1.6.6

New buildings should not have a street frontage width more than 2.5 times their height. Buildings with
extensive street frontage should avoid long homogenous facades. They should have a scale, size, massing,
shape, roof line and exterior finish that is sufficiently varied and articulated as to give the impression of
separate small units, rather than a large mass.

E.1.6.7

The existing "rhythm" of buildings along street frontages should be respected. Buildings that replace
existing structures should retain the original width of the front elevation and the spacing between buildings.
In Fulford Harbour particularly, the size, spacing, front elevation width and orientation of buildings along

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

14

October 2020

Fulford-Ganges and Morningside roads should be retained by any new development.
E.1.6.8

In Ganges Village, new development along Lower Ganges Road north of Upper Ganges Road, should be
massed with articulation and rhythms similar to existing non-commercial development. The development of
a commercial strip appearance along the road should be avoided.

E.1.6.9

Landmark buildings should not be created in island villages.
ROOF DESIGN

E.1.6.10 To encourage use of the village during all seasons, continuous weather protection should be provided for
pedestrians along sidewalks. The minimum width should be 1.5 m.
E.1.6.11 All roof-top mechanical equipment (satellite dishes, air-conditioning) should be screened from view.
WINDOW AND DOOR DESIGN
E.1.6.12

Large areas of curtain-wall glazing should not be used.

E.1.6.13 The use of handcrafted doors made by local artisans is encouraged.
DETAILS
E.1.6.14 The use of imaginative, handcrafted products of local craftspeople is encouraged. In Fulford Harbour
Village particularly, natural and "found" materials should be incorporated into exterior details by local
artisans, in keeping with existing development. More conventional or formal materials should be avoided.
E.1.6.15 A pleasant pedestrian environment in villages should be enhanced by pedestrian-oriented features.
E.1.6.16 Development along Ganges and Fulford Harbours should incorporate and retain existing docks, wharves
and buildings that reflect traditional harbour uses such as freight storage and fishing fleet service.
E.1.6.17 All portions of a building should be authentic, functional space - artificial or contrived architectural features
(for example, artificial lighthouses, windmills or turrets) should not be included in building designs.
E.1.6.18 Blank walls visible from pedestrian routes or roadways should be treated with landscaping, architectural
features or artwork. At least half of the surface should be covered.
E.1.6.19 Large new developments should have their electrical and telephone connections provided underground.
E.1.6.20 Facilities should be provided for convenient, barrier-free access for the disabled.
E.1.7

Guidelines for Landscaping and Parking Surfaces

E.1.7.1

Informal, natural landscaping that gives a native appearance is encouraged as opposed to formal,
decorative plantings. Hard surfacing should not be used as a substitute for vegetation.

E.1.7.2

Landscaping adjacent to Ganges and Fulford Harbours should be left in as natural a state as possible.
Existing trees should be incorporated. Designs should display natural features such as attractive rock
outcroppings, tidal pools and mature trees.

E.1.7.3

Plant materials should be durable, low-maintenance types. Care should be taken not to obscure sight lines
at intersections and parking lot entrances.

E.1.7.4

Landscaping should be used to as an integral part of developments and should help in the function and
organization of a site; to create the sense of entry into buildings and to define and enliven public spaces.
While screening of unattractive building features is important, landscaping should be designed to ensure a
broader function.

Salt Spring Island Local Trust Committee
Official Community Plan Bylaw No. 434 – Volume 2 (Consolidated)

October 2020

BL488
(07/20)

E.1.7.5

Soft landscaping should cover a minimum of 40% of parcel areas in multifamily residential developments and
at least 20% of the parcel area in commercial and general employment developments. Developments that
provide special needs housing or affordable seniors’ supportive housing may have a reduced area of soft
landscaping if necessary to accommodate special facilities, providing that neighbouring properties are
buffered by a vegetation screen and that parking lots are landscaped as outlined in Guideline E.1.7.16. The
area calculated as soft landscaping does not include parking areas, vehicle lanes and manoeuvring areas,
private open space and adjacent boulevards on public lands.

E.1.7.6

All landscaping work on major new developments should meet the British Columbia Landscape Standard
published by the British Columbia Society of Landscape Architects and the British Columbia Nursery Trades
Association and should be covered by a performance bond for a period of one year from the date of final
installation, in order to ensure survival or replacement of plantings. All landscaping should be maintained in
perpetuity.

E.1.7.7

All hard and soft landscaping and paving, including sidewalks, pedestrian amenities, street furniture, cycle
racks and parking lot lines on major new developments should be installed prior to issuance of any building
occupancy permit. A letter of credit should be deposited for an amount equal to 150% of the cost of the
work to be completed.

E.1.7.8

Plant materials should be chosen with a view to conserve water.

E.1.7.9

Landscaping next to creeks within villages should be left natural and wild to retain fish habitat. Species with
a high water demand or that may require the use of pesticides or fertilizers should not be located in this
area. Bark mulches and impermeable landscape fabric should not be used. Landscaping should be
consistent with guidelines in Development Permit Area 4.

E.1.7.10 Special care should be taken to retain existing vegetation and incorporate it into new development.
Particular attention should be paid within Channel Ridge Village to the preservation of Garry Oak and
Arbutus trees and to the unique habitat that surrounds them.
E.1.7.11 Other existing natural site features such as rock formations and ground contours should be preserved.
E.1.7.12 Care should be taken to ensure that new landscape features enhance, but will not block existing ocean
views from roads and public areas as they mature.
E.1.7.13 Fencing should be natural in appearance and coordinated with the design of the main building. Appropriate
materials are those that reflect a natural, locally crafted character, such as local stone, heavy timbers or
local wood.
E.1.7.14 The use of trees and other vegetation along roadways in a manner that "crowds" the street, and causes
automotive traffic to slow is strongly encouraged.
E.1.7.15 Deciduous boulevard trees should be included with a spacing of 10 m in all large new commercial and multifamily projects in Ganges Village with frontage on Fulford-Ganges and Lower Ganges Roads.
E.1.7.16 Parking lots should be carefully landscaped to screen them from adjacent streets and land uses, to provide
shade and to avoid large expanses of uninterrupted asphalt. The following landscape guidelines apply
specifically to parking lots, including off-site parking lots:
a.

Parking lots with street frontage should be screened by a landscaped strip with a minimum width of 3
m. The perimeter of parking lots should also be screened with a minimum width of 2 m.

b.

Parking lots with more than 10 spaces should include interior landscaping islands and peninsulas that
occupy at least 5 per cent of the lot area besides the street frontage and perimeter strips. Irregular
shapes of parking islands are encouraged, especially those incorporating existing vegetation naturally
and informally.

c.

Reductions in parking space requirements may be requested to accommodate adequate parking lot
landscaping.

d.

The use of permeable parking materials such as "hard grass" is strongly encouraged to soften the
visual effect of parking lots and minimize changes to site drainage.

E.1.7.17 Parking lots should be surfaced and lined before issuance of an occupancy permit to ensure efficient use.
Alternatives to paving such as interlocking or permeable pavers are encouraged. Unpaved parking lots may
be considered in some locations provided lots have less than 10 spaces and other techniques are used to
ensure efficient use. Unpaved parking lots are encouraged in Fulford Harbour Village. Driveways providing
access to multifamily developments should employ speed control devices at entries.
E.1.7.18 Sidewalks, patios and decks should be constructed of natural materials or interlocking pavers. Brushed
concrete and asphalt should be avoided. In Fulford Harbour in particular, sidewalks should be carefully and
creatively designed to ensure that the informal and somewhat irregular character of the village is retained.
E.1.7.19 Pathways that form part of the Ganges Public Pathway System should usually consist of natural materials.
Pathway width should be a minimum of 1 m.
E.1.7.20 All multifamily developments should include landscaped areas for individual and group activities of a
recreational or social nature. At least 9 m 2 of private open space should be provided for each dwelling unit.
Developments that provide special needs housing or affordable seniors’ supportive housing may provide
less private open space, if areas for outdoor group activities are provided.
E.1.7.21 Multifamily developments designed for families should also include at least 2.5 m2 of children's play area for
each bedroom in the development, excluding master bedrooms.

E.1.7.22

Where the property being subdivided or developed adjoins agricultural land, a vegetated buffer is to be
planted or retained. The buffer should be 8 metres wide, with a minimum recommended height at plant
maturity of 6 metres, and should be consistent with the Landscaped Buffer Specifications (ALC, 1993)
developed by the Agricultural Land Commission, and the Guide to Edge Planning (2015), developed by the
BC Ministry of Agriculture. The buffer area should be protected from disturbance by a covenant.

E.1.8

Guidelines for Lighting

BL488
(07/20)

E.1.8.1

Lighting of commercial and general employment sites should be kept to the minimum necessary for
pedestrian safety and visibility. A low level of light should be maintained in the night time atmosphere of
villages. Lighting in parking lots should be adequate for security purposes.

BL488
(07/20)

E.1.8.2

Light fixtures on commercial and general employment sites should be carefully chosen to focus light on the
area to be illuminated. The spillage of light into onsite residential areas, neighbouring properties, streets or
other public areas including the sea should be avoided. Fixtures should not result in glare when viewed from
residential areas that overlook villages.

E.1.8.3

Light fixtures should be simple and unobtrusive in design. The use of indirect lighting mounted on the fronts
and sides of village buildings is encouraged.

E.1.8.4

Incandescent fixtures are preferred.

E.1.8.5

Light fixtures mounted on masts or walls should be pedestrian in scale and should not exceed 3.5 m in
height.

E.1.8.6

Lighting should be provided along the Ganges Public Pathway System. Light fixtures provided along the
seawalk portion of the System should be of consistent height and design.

E.1.8.7

Flashing or strobe lights should not be used to attract attention to commercial uses.

E.1.9

Sign Guidelines

E.1.9.1

Signs should be coordinated with buildings in terms of location, scale, materials, finishes and colours.

E.1.9.2

Signs should be kept to the minimum size and number needed to inform and direct residents and visitors.
Sign size and lettering should not exceed that necessary to direct pedestrians and slow-moving traffic:
letters should rarely exceed 20 cm in height; the area of individual signs should rarely exceed 2.5 m 2. Total
permitted sign area should not exceed that permitted by local bylaw.

E.1.9.3

All signs should be kept at a pedestrian viewing level. They should not obstruct pedestrian traffic. Some
exceptions to the guidelines in this Section may be considered for marine-oriented businesses which offer
services to marine traffic. However care must be taken to ensure that the character of the harbour as
viewed from the sea is not dominated by commercial signs.

E.1.9.4

Signs should be constructed of natural materials, preferably with a handcrafted look. Plastic, back lit signs
should not to be used, especially those dominated by product logos and trademarks.

E.1.9.5

Front-lit signs with soft light levels are preferable.

E.1.9.6

Signs should not move or be audible. They should not incorporate lighting that moves or flashes or gives
the impression of doing so. Neon lighting should not be used outside buildings.

E.1.10 Guidelines regarding Stormwater Drainage and Water Pollution
BL488
(07/20)

E.1.10.1

New commercial, general employment, institutional and multi-family residential developments that will
create more than 280 m 2 of new impervious surfacing should include a report prepared by a Professional
Engineer that determines the extent of changes to the natural drainage. It should identify any conditions
that should be incorporated into the development permit to protect property from flooding, erosion or from
other undesirable impacts as the result of changes to stormwater runoff. Particular attention should be paid
to ensuring that drainage changes will not result in detrimental impacts such as flooding or reduced
groundwater availability on agricultural lands or watercourses that either adjoin the development or are
located in the same watershed.

E.1.10.2 Developments that would create less than 280 m 2 of impervious surface area should not alter drainage in a
way that would cause detrimental impacts on other properties, including agricultural land. The Local Trust
Committee could request that a drainage plan be prepared by a Professional Engineer to assist it in
establishing development permit conditions related to drainage,
E.1.10.3 Development should not result in the pollution of surface or groundwater supplies. Particular care should be
taken to ensure that there are no detrimental impacts on agricultural land or to fishbearing watercourses
because of water pollution.
Note:

Applicants are referred to B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks (1992) for
mechanisms to minimize storm water pollution in a manner that will meet the objectives
and guidelines of this Development Permit Area.

DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AREA 2 - NON-VILLAGE COMMERCIAL AND GENERAL EMPLOYMENT

E.2.1

Description of Permit Area and Exemptions

E.2.1.1

Development Permit Area 2 is shown on Map 19. It is designated according to Section 879(1)(e) of the
Municipal Act to identify objectives and guidelines for the form and character of commercial and general
employment development outside Village Designations. It is also designated according to Section 879 (1)(c)
for the protection of farming on adjacent lands.
Background Note:

subdivision of land zoned for commercial or general employment use.
subdivision of land that adjoins agricultural land or that drains into agricultural land.
development of more than 15 new tourist accommodation units or campsites on a property where no
such units are in operation.
development of new retail, general employment or commercial space greater than 185 m 2 in gross
floor area that is visible from public areas or other properties.
development of new restaurants, pubs, or marinas on a property where such a use is not in operation.
development of a commercial or general employment parking lot with more than 15 spaces that is
visible from public areas or other properties.
development of more than 280 m 2 of new impervious surfaces, or alteration of the existing drainage
regime on lands that adjoin or drain into agricultural land.
removal of vegetation within 8 m of agricultural land (excluding the emergency removal of a
hazardous tree).
development of a commercial composting facility subject to the Capital Regional District Composting
Facilities Regulation Bylaw.
removal of vegetation within 7.5 m of a lot line that abuts land zoned for residential or commercial
guest accommodation uses (excluding the emergency removal of a hazardous tree).

Reasons for this Development Permit Area
Existing local zoning provides a significant potential for new commercial and general employment
development on properties located within residential and rural neighbourhoods. Other policies in this Plan
could lead to more intensive development on existing general employment properties.
Other policies and objectives of this Plan recognize the community's desire to retain a quiet, rural character
in island neighbourhoods.
Design guidelines can reduce the potential conflicts between large new commercial and general employment
development and neighbouring properties.
Some properties in this Development Permit Area adjoin or drain into land that is in the Agricultural Land
Reserve or that has been traditionally used for agricultural activities. The higher densities of development
permitted in this Area could have negative effects on nearby agricultural activities, if that development is not
carefully managed. By paying attention to the design of development in this Area, the potential for on-going
conflicts between agricultural activities and higher density development can be minimized.

Background Note:

E.2.4

Development Permits that are issued for developments in this Development Permit
Area could contain conditions that are based on the following guidelines. Not all
guidelines will apply to every permit. Permits will not contain conditions that are
unrelated to these guidelines. The conditions on a Development Permit will not
prevent a property from being used as the local zoning bylaw allows.

Guidelines for General Site Design, Building Location and Access

E.2.4.1

Property line setbacks should not be varied from those allowed by local bylaws.

E.2.4.2

Site access to commercial and general employment properties should maintain the character of the
surrounding neighbourhood as much as possible; there should ideally be only one access to a commercial or
general employment property from the public street.

E.2.4.3

Sites should be designed to minimize impacts on neighbouring properties and public areas, including water
surfaces. Particular attention should be paid to locating and screening loading docks, garbage and recycling
containers and other service areas so that visual and noise impacts are minimal.

BL488
(07/20)

E.2.4.4

An effective vegetation screen, providing a visual barrier, noise abatement, and dust barrier, as required,
should be maintained along any boundary with a non-commercial or non-general employment property.

BL488
(07/20)

E.2.4.5

Developments adjoining agricultural lands should be designed to minimize conflicts with that land. The
location of access roads, the siting of structures and the layout of subdivisions should follow the edge
planning guidelines developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands and the Agricultural Land
Commission as a guide to implementing the Farm Practices Protection (Right to Farm) Act (MAFF, 1996).
Site designs should allow for a vegetated buffer, as outlined in Guideline E.2.8.7.

Guidelines for Development
Background Note:

Development Permits that are issued for developments in this Development Permit
Area could contain conditions that are based on the following guidelines. Not all
guidelines will apply to every permit. Permits will not contain conditions that are
unrelated to these guidelines. The conditions on a Development Permit will not
prevent a property from being used as the local zoning bylaw allows.

While forest management activities within the Forest Land Reserve are excluded from the Permit process,
voluntary compliance with the guidelines of this section is encouraged for such activities.
E.3.4.1

All work that takes place below the natural boundary of the sea should be done in a way that minimizes
degradation of water quality and disturbance of the substrate.

E.3.4.2

All work that takes place on land within 10 m of the natural boundary of the sea should be planned and
carried out in a way that is consistent with the Land Development Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic
Habitat (Appendix 7).

E.3.4.3

Native vegetation and trees are to be retained or replaced to control erosion, protect banks and protect fish
and wildlife habitat.

E.3.4.4

New roads and septic systems should not be located in this Development Permit Area. If such a location
cannot be avoided, then the design and construction of the road or septic system should be supervised by a
qualified professional to ensure that the objectives and guidelines of this Area are met.

E.3.4.5

Structures should provide for the thorough flushing of all enclosed water areas and should not restrict the
movement of aquatic life or interfere with natural shoreline processes.

E.3.4.6

E.3.4.7

New boating facilities that provide transient moorage should not be constructed unless access is available to
adequate and convenient facilities for pump-out, holding and treating of sewage from boats. New boating
facilities should be designed, located, and operated in a way that ensures there will be no discharge of toxic
material from boats (for example: fuels, oils, maintenance by-products).

E.3.4.8

There should be no dredging to create new facilities. Maintenance dredging of existing facilities should be
limited to the minimum area necessary to maximize the capacity of the existing facility. Dredging should be
done with the use of silt curtains to prevent siltation of adjacent areas.

E.3.4.9

The shoreline should not be filled in to create additional land, except minor areas of fill necessary to
complete the boardwalk section of the Ganges Public Pathway System in Ganges Harbour.

E.3.4.10 No parking areas should be located over the surface of the water, on land created by fill, or on accretion
shoreforms.
E.3.4.11 Boat launch ramps should be located on stable, non-erosional banks where a minimum amount of substrate
disturbance or stabilization is necessary. Ramps should be kept flush with the slope of the foreshore to
minimize interruption of geo-hydraulic processes.
E.3.4.12 Preference is to be given to the placement of mooring buoys and floats instead of docks. It is also to be
given to the construction of joint use docks rather than individual ones. Multifamily and strata-titled
developments are to construct joint use dock facilities. No more than one facility for mooring boats is to be
located next to any parcel. An exception could be made if more than one joint facility is to be located next to
the common property of a strata development.
E.3.4.13 Docks should not be located over shellfish beds or lead to the removal of any kelp or eel grass beds.
E.3.4.14 Large residential docks should be located and designed to avoid the need for shore defence works, or
breakwaters. If a bulkhead is to be constructed as a base for a dock, it should be constructed landward of
the natural boundary of the sea.
E.3.4.15 Structures in contact with the water should be constructed of stable materials, including finishes and
preservatives that will not degrade water quality.
E.3.4.16 Piers should use the minimum number of pilings necessary, with preference to large spans over more
pilings.
E.3.4.17 Piers should be constructed with a minimum clearance of 0.5 m above the elevation of the natural boundary
of the sea.
E.3.4.18 All docks should be constructed so that they do not rest on the bottom of the foreshore at low water levels.
E.3.4.19 Any plastic foams or other non-biodegradable materials used in construction of floats and docks should be
well contained to prevent escape into the natural environment.
E.3.4.20 Residential docks should not extend from shore any further than necessary to accommodate a small
pleasure craft. Residential docks should not accommodate boats with a draft greater than 2.2 m or have
floats more than 35 m2 total surface area unless more than two parcels have legal access to the dock.
E.3.4.21 Applications for shoreline stabilization should include a report, prepared by a Professional Engineer with
experience in geotechnical engineering, which describes the proposed modification and shows:
a.
the need for the proposed modification to protect existing structures.
b.
where the modification is proposed to protect new structures, the locations on the property where
those structures could be built and not require shoreline modification.
c.
if any natural hazards, erosion, or interruption of geohydraulic processes may arise from the proposal
modification, including at sites on other properties or foreshore locations.

the cumulative effect of shoreline stabilization works along the drift sector where the works are
proposed.
whether there will be any degradation of water quality or loss of fish or wildlife habitat because of the
modification.
whether conditions should be incorporated into the development permit to achieve the objectives of
this Development Permit Area.

E.3.4.22 Shoreline stabilization should be limited to that necessary
a.
to prevent damage to existing structures or an established use on adjacent upland.
b.
to prevent damage to a proposed public land use.
New upland structures or additions should be located and designed to avoid or reduce the need for
shoreline stabilization. Shoreline stabilization should not interrupt natural processes solely to reduce erosion
of undeveloped land, except agricultural land.
E.3.4.23 Shoreline stabilization works should use natural means such as vegetative stabilization or protective berms
rather than structural solutions such as concrete or large riprap. Applications for structural stabilization
works should provide an explanation as to the need for structural solutions. Structural solutions should not
be employed in the Shoreline Conservation Designation, unless an existing building is threatened by wave
erosion and cannot be protected by other means.
E.3.4.24 Materials used for shoreline stabilization should consist of inert materials. Stabilization materials should not
consist of debris or contaminated material that could result in pollution of tidal waters.
E.3.4.25 Rock weirs, groins and jetties should not be constructed. An exception could be made if it can be shown
that they are part of a larger system that will reduce the need for overall shoreline modification and that they
are intended to prevent damage to existing structures. They should not be proposed to protect new
structures.
E.3.4.26 Bulkheads should only be constructed if no other alternative exists. Where bulkheads are proposed, they
should not to be located where geohydraulic processes are critical to shoreline conservation. Feeder bluffs,
marshes, wetlands, spits or hooks should be avoided. Bulkheads should be located parallel to and
landward of the natural boundary of the sea, as close to any natural bank as possible. Bulkheads should
allow the passage of surface or groundwater without causing ponding or saturation. They should be
constructed of stable, non-erodible materials that preserve natural shoreline characteristics. Adequate toe
protection including proper footings and retention mesh should be included. Beach materials should not be
used for fill behind bulkheads.
E.3.4.27 Where revetments are proposed, they should not result in the loss of riparian vegetation or fish habitat. The
size and quantity of materials used should be limited to that necessary to withstand the estimated energy of
the location's hydraulic action and prevent collapse. Filter cloth should be used to aid drainage.
E.3.4.28 Where this Area includes unique native species dependent on a marine shoreline habitat which have been
identified by a qualified professional as worthy of particular protection, their habitat areas should be left
undisturbed. If development is permitted in these areas, it should be undertaken only under the supervision
of a professional who is qualified in environmental protection, with advice from the Ministry of Environment,
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, or Environment Canada.
E.3.4.29 To assist in the preparation of development permits for larger projects, the Local Trust Committee could
request an applicant to provide a report, prepared by a qualified professional with experience in the
protection of the natural environment. The report should indicate the type of conditions that should be
incorporated into the development permit to achieve the objectives and comply with the guidelines of this
Development Permit Area.

E.3.4.30 Buildings built over the water surface in areas zoned for commercial and general employment use in
Ganges and Fulford Harbour should accommodate continuous pedestrian passage along the waterfront.
Developments in Ganges should contribute to the development of the Ganges Public Pathway System,
including the seawalk portion, shown on Map 17. New sections of the seawalk should be built in a way that
is consistent with existing portions, ensuring barrier-free access along the entire route. For public safety,
light fixtures should be provided at a consistent height and design.
E.3.4.31 Buildings built over the water surface should not exceed the heights allowed in the local zoning bylaw.

E.3.4.32 Lighting of commercial and general employment developments built over the water surface should be kept
to the minimum necessary for safety and visibility. Light fixtures on such sites should be simple and
unobtrusive in design. They should be carefully chosen to focus light on the area to be illuminated and avoid
spillage of light into other areas. Fixtures should not result in glare when viewed from areas that overlook
the sea. Low-glare fixtures with a high cut-off angle should be used. Full-spectrum fixtures are preferred.
Neon lighting should not be used outside buildings.

DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AREA 4 - LAKES, STREAMS and WETLANDS
Note:

E.4.1
E.4.1.1

While this Development Permit Area extends only 10 m from the natural boundary of
some streams, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the B.C. Ministry
of Environment recommend that the area within at least 15 m of the top of the bank of
streams be left undisturbed to ensure that fish habitat is protected. It is an offence
under the Fisheries Act to do anything that results in the harmful alteration, disruption
or destruction of fish habitat. Property owners with land that lies within 15 m of the top
of the bank of a fish bearing stream should ensure that they take appropriate
precautions, even if their land is not within this Development Permit Area.

Description of Development Permit Area and Exemptions
Development Permit Area 4 is shown on Map 21. It is made up of the island's major lakes, streams and
wetlands. It also encloses the land (measured horizontally) that is within 10 m of the natural boundary of
streams, the land that is within 300 m of the natural boundary of Maxwell Lake and the land that is within 61
m of the natural boundary of all other island lakes, except for the land in Development Permit Area 3.
Development Permit Area 4 is designated according to Section 879 (1) (a) of the Municipal Act to protect the

the maintenance of natural drainage and protection of environmentally sensitive areas.
works undertaken by a waterworks district that have been certified by a Professional Engineer as
consistent with the Land Development Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Habitat.

Reasons for this Development Permit Area

E.4.2.1

The lakes and streams in this Development Permit Area provide natural fish and wildlife habitat. Many also
supply drinking water to individual license holders or community water supply systems. If not carefully
managed, development in this Area could result in degradation of water quality. Poor water quality would be
detrimental to fish and wildlife populations and could lead to increased costs for remedial drinking water
treatment.

E.4.2.2

This Development Permit Area contains riparian habitat that is important to many different species and is
particularly susceptible to disturbance. Development in this Area could lead to the disturbance or loss of a
disproportionately large number of different native plant and animal species.

E.4.3

Objectives of this Development Permit Area

E.4.3.1

To protect the quality of drinking water supplies.

E.4.3.2

To protect fish habitat.

E.4.3.3

To protect sensitive riparian habitat and the unique species that depends upon it.

E.4.4

Guidelines for New Development
Background Note:

Development Permits that are issued for developments in this Development Permit
Area could contain conditions that are based on the following guidelines. Not all
guidelines will apply to every permit. Permits will not contain conditions that are
unrelated to these guidelines. The conditions on a Development Permit will not
prevent a property from being used as the local zoning bylaw allows.

While forest management activities within the Forest Land Reserve are excluded from the Permit process,
voluntary compliance with the guidelines of this section is encouraged for such activities.
E.4.4.1

All work that takes place in this Development Permit Area should be done in a way that minimizes
degradation in water quality and disturbance to natural drainage patterns.

E.4.4.2

All work that takes place on land within 10 m of the natural boundary of a lake or stream (or within 300 m of
Maxwell Lake) or within a wetland should be planned and carried out in a way that is consistent with the
Land Development Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Habitat (Appendix 7).

E.4.4.3

Native vegetation and trees are to be retained or replaced to control erosion, protect banks and protect fish
and wildlife habitat.

E.4.4.4

New roads and septic fields should not be located in this Development Permit Area. If such a location
cannot be avoided, then the design and construction of the road or septic field should be supervised by a
qualified professional to ensure that the objectives and guidelines of this Area are met. Septic systems that
are adjacent to lakes or to streams that drain to lakes should be designed to minimize both nutrient loading
and coliform contamination of lake waters.

E.4.4.5

Where this Area includes unique native species dependent on riparian habitat which have been identified by
a qualified professional as worthy of particular protection, their habitat areas should be left undisturbed. If
development is permitted, it should be undertaken only under the supervision of a professional who is

Reasons for this Development Permit Area
This Development Permit Area is made up of the area that drains into wells used by community water
systems. If not carefully managed, development in this Area could result in the degradation of drinking
water quality for many homes. Prevention of water quality degradation is much less costly than remediating
an aquifer after contamination has occurred.
Objectives of this Development Permit Area
To protect the quality of drinking water supplied from community water system wells.

It is a policy of the Islands Trust Council that Local Trust Committees shall in their Official Community Plans
and regulatory bylaws, address means to prevent further loss or degradation of freshwater bodies or water
courses, wetlands or riparian zones and to protect aquatic wildlife.
Furthermore, the province of British Columbia’s Fish Protection Act, requires that local governments
establish regulations to protect riparian areas. This designation is intended to protect riparian areas from
development so that the areas can provide natural features, functions and conditions that support fish life
processes.

Information Note:

E.7.6

Despite these exemption provisions, property owners must meet all applicable local,
provincial or federal requirements. Some activities not listed in this section that are
regulated under other provincial or federal legislation may not require a development
permit. While many activities are exempt from the Permit Process, voluntary
compliance with the guidelines of this section is encouraged for all activities.

Guidelines for New Development
Prior to undertaking any applicable development activities within Development Permit Area 7, the property
owner shall apply to the Local Trust Committee for a development permit, and the following guidelines apply:

E.7.6.1

The property owner shall be required, in addition to any other application requirements enacted or imposed
by the Local Trust Committee, to provide at their expense an assessment report from a Qualified
Environmental Professional which has been submitted per the Riparian Areas Regulation.

E.7.6.2

The Local Trust Committee may impose permit conditions based on the assessment report including:
a. Require specified natural features or areas to be preserved, protected, restored or enhanced in
accordance with the permit.
b. Require natural water courses to be dedicated.
c. Require works to be constructed to preserve, protect, restore or enhance natural water courses or other
specified natural features of the environment.
d. Require protection measures, including that vegetation or trees be planted or retained in order to:
i. preserve, protect, restore or enhance fish habitat or riparian areas;
ii. control drainage, or;
iii. control erosion or protect banks.

E.7.6.3

The Local Trust Committee shall require a security for developments clearing greater than 280m 2 (3,012 ft2)
of land within the Development Permit Area. Security shall be returned upon confirmation by a Qualified
Environmental Professional that assessment report conditions have been satisfactorily addressed.

E.7.6.4

Security shall be provided to secure satisfactory completion of habitat protection works, restoration
measures, or other works for the streams and streamside habitat (the “required works”). The security shall
be 150% of the estimated value of the required works as determined by the Local Trust Committee.

E.7.6.5

The development permit should not allow any development activities to take place within any Streamside
Protection and Enhancement Area identified by the Qualified Environmental Professional and the property
owner should be required to follow any measures identified by the Qualified Environmental Professional for
protecting the Streamside Protection and Enhancement Area over the long term and these measures should
be included as conditions of the development permit. The width of the Streamside Protection and
Enhancement Area may be less than the width of the Development Permit Area.

E.7.6.6

Where a Qualified Environmental Professional or other professional’s report describes an area within the
Development Permit Area as suitable for development, that is, where the Streamside Protection and
Enhancement Area is less than the width of the Development Permit Area, the development permit should
only allow the development to occur in compliance with the measures described in the report. Monitoring
and regular reporting by a Qualified Environmental Professional or other professional at the property owner’s
expense should be required during construction and development phases, as specified in a development
permit.

E.7.6.7

If the nature of the proposed project within the Development Permit Area changes after the professional
report has been prepared such that it is reasonable to assume that the professional’s assessment of the
impact of the development may be affected, the Local Trust Committee may require the property owner to
have the professional update the assessment at the property owner’s expense and development permit
conditions may be amended accordingly.

HERITAGE CONSERVATION AREAS

F.1

HERITAGE CONSERVATION AREA 1 - GANGES VILLAGE CORE

F.1.1

Description of Permit Area and Exemptions

F.1.1.1

Heritage Conservation Area 1 is shown on Map 25. It is designated according to Section 880 (1) of the
Municipal Act to conserve the community's cultural heritage.

F.1.1.2

All development in this Heritage Conservation Area is exempted from the requirement to obtain a Heritage
Alteration Permit, except:
a.
b.

c.
d.
e.
F.1.2

Structural alterations or additions to the exterior of buildings or structures listed in Section F.1.5,
including alterations to add or remove windows or doors.
Exterior repairs or non-structural alterations to the buildings listed in Section F.1.5 where the original
materials are not to be either salvaged and reused or simulated by new materials on visible parts of
the building.
Construction or alteration of a building or structure greater than one storey in height on a property that
adjoins a property with a building listed in Section F.1.5.
The removal of heritage trees listed in Section F.1.5, unless the tree is identified as unsafe by an
arborist or is causing an immediate threat to life or property.
The consolidation of land parcels.

Reasons for this Heritage Conservation Area
Ganges Village has played an important part in the development of Salt Spring Island and of the Southern
Gulf Islands for over one hundred years. Many of the island's earliest commercial enterprises and larger
residences were in Ganges Village due to the presence of a relatively deep draft harbour and nearby farms.
Several original buildings still stand and their preservation is an objective of this Plan.
The future development of Ganges Village could result in a loss of the community's cultural heritage if the
identifiable heritage features and character of the village are not recognized and if changes to them are not
carefully managed.

F.1.3

Objective of this Heritage Conservation Area
The objectives of the Ganges Village Core Heritage Conservation Area are:

F.1.3.1

To identify and protect the heritage significance of the Ganges Village Core in a way that reinforces the
village's appearance and its economic value and stability for property owners and the community.

F.1.3.2

To guide changes made to the exteriors of buildings of heritage value so that their heritage character is
retained.

F.1.3.3

To avoid the assembly and consolidation or joint development of small frontage parcels in Ganges Village
Core that would facilitate the removal of heritage structures. To avoid the construction of structures that
span several original land parcels.

F.1.3.4

To promote the retention or salvage of heritage orchard trees, mature trees and hedges and
commemorative trees in the Area.

Guidelines for Conserving Community Heritage
Background Note:

Heritage Alteration Permits that are issued for developments in this Heritage
Conservation Area could contain conditions that are based on the following guidelines.
Not all guidelines will apply to every permit. Permits will not contain conditions that
are unrelated to these guidelines. The conditions on a Heritage Conservation Permit
will not prevent a property from being used as the local zoning bylaw allows.

F.1.6.1

Structural alterations to protected buildings listed in Section F.1.5 should salvage and reuse original
materials wherever practical and should retain or restore the building's original architecture. Where original
materials cannot be salvaged, new durable materials should be used that simulate the original materials.
Particular attention should be given to replicating the materials and patterns of original roofing surfaces; the
materials, widths and types of original siding; and the size, shape, number, pattern and spacing of original
windows and doors. Whenever possible, photographs or drawings produced near the time of original
construction should be used to ensure authentic restoration.

F.1.6.2

Additions to buildings listed in Section F.1.5 should be made in a way that retains or restores the original
architecture of the building exterior. They should not detract from its heritage character. Roof slopes should
be retained and reflected in building additions. Additions or alterations should use sizes and spacings of
windows and doors that reflect the sizes and architectural rhythms found in the original building. Additions
should have a smaller mass and lower height than original buildings to which they are attached, and should
maintain setbacks from roads. They should be carefully designed to complement and focus attention on the
original building, rather than detract from its significance. Additions to protected buildings listed in Section
F.1.5 should not obstruct views of the protected building from public roads and areas, including the sea.

F.1.6.3

New buildings constructed next to protected heritage buildings should not generally exceed the height of
protected heritage buildings or obstruct views of them from public areas. Where new buildings on adjoining
properties are to be of a greater height than a heritage building, special attention should be paid to ensuring
that its architecture is compatible with the heritage building. Site layouts should focus attention on the
heritage building.

F.1.6.4

Fruit trees and mature trees that are protected heritage property should be retained in place where possible
or relocated to elsewhere on the same parcel where they are situated. They should not be pruned or moved
without advice from a certified arborist experienced in the preservation of heritage fruit trees. Fruit trees
identified as protected heritage property that are to be removed should be offered to a local agricultural or
historical society for salvage.

F.1.6.5

Commemorative trees in Centennial Park and on the grounds of Salt Spring Elementary School should not
be altered or removed unless they have been found unsafe or unhealthy by a certified arborist. Trees
removed should be replaced by other commemorative trees that can be expected to have a similar scale
and visual impact as the existing trees. The significance of new commemorative trees should be identified
by a permanent plaque positioned nearby.

F.1.6.6

Mature vegetation, including hedges, which provides a visual backdrop or context for protected heritage
buildings listed in Section F.1.5, should be retained. Standard horticultural guidelines for retention of mature
vegetation should be followed.

F.1.6.7

Parking requirements and building setbacks may be relaxed on properties containing protected heritage
property to help retain heritage character on the property.

F.1.6.8

To retain the existing spacing and rhythm of buildings, no structure should straddle the original property lines
of land parcels with frontage on Rainbow Road, Hereford Avenue, or McPhillips Avenue between Jackson
Avenue and Lower Ganges Road.

F.1.6.9

Where demolition or significant alteration of protected heritage property is proposed, the development
proponent may be required to provide a heritage impact assessment, prepared by a qualified individual.

F.1.6.10 To guarantee the performance of the terms, requirements and conditions of a Heritage Alteration Permit,
security may be required in a form and in any amount satisfactory to the Local Trust Committee.

local government. Such uses may include waste disposal or transfer, communications or transportation.

G.1.2.3

The temporary use of land that is compatible with land use designations, but are not specifically allowed by
the local zoning bylaw. Such uses may be transitional or there may be uncertainty as to their
appropriateness or viability. It may be premature or inappropriate to decide upon rezoning and long-term
land use changes.

G.1.2.4

Farm-oriented commercial uses consistent with agricultural which enhance the economic viability of an
existing farm operation. Examples may include farm fairs, farm-oriented tourism or educational activities,
and food service or market events serving local farm products. Such uses are subject to approval of the

APPENDIX 2 - GUIDELINES FOR SHARED RESIDENTIAL ZONING APPLICATIONS
Background Note:

H.2.1

Many larger properties on Salt Spring Island have the potential, under existing local
zoning, to be further subdivided. However, without subdivision, local zoning allows
only one home on most of these parcels, despite their size. A policy in the Affordable
Housing Section says that the Local Trust Committee should consider rezoning
applications that would allow the property owner to build (without subdividing) the
same number of single family dwellings on the lot as would result from subdivision of
the lot. This new zoning has been called "Shared Residential" since it makes it easier
for people to share ownership of a property.

Guidelines for Shared Residential Zoning Applications
Applications for Shared Residential Zoning should be consistent with the points listed below.

H.2.1.1

The total number of dwelling units that would be allowed following the zoning change must not exceed the
number that could be constructed after subdivision of the land under the zoning in place at the time of
application.

H.2.1.2

Applications should be consistent with the other policies in this Plan regarding rezoning.

H.2.1.3

Applications should be accompanied by a site development plan, that will be registered by covenant on the
property prior to rezoning, that identifies all proposed building sites, and which addresses the following
points:
a.
b.

c.
d.
e.
f.

g.

Building sites should not to be subject to geological hazards.
Building sites should be clustered in about 20-30% of the parcel, with the remainder of the land left as
open space. Open space should be designed to include Environmentally Sensitive Areas or good
agricultural soils on the property.
Building sites should be screened by natural vegetation from public roads, neighbouring properties
and farmland.
driveway access to building sites should be minimized with shared driveways, although each site must
be accessible to emergency vehicles.
buildings sites and driveways should be positioned and constructed to fit local topography and to
minimize impacts on the environment.
where subdivision of the property could have resulted in the dedication of public parkland and public
access to a water body, they should also be dedicated as part of a Shared Residential Zoning
application.
buildings should incorporate sustainable building criteria, including, but not necessarily limited to,
energy efficiency and water conservation measures.

APPENDIX 3 - AMENITY ZONING

Amenity zoning is the granting of additional development potential by the Local Trust Committee in exchange for the
voluntary provision of a community amenity by the land owner. Any amenity rezoning should advance the Object of the
Islands Trust and the goals and objectives of this OCP, and should be consistent with the following guidelines.
Amenity rezoning may be considered on a case-by-case basis, upon application for rezoning. The approval of an
amenity rezoning should be conditional on compliance with the following policy guidelines. These guidelines do not
pre-determine a favourable outcome for any particular application.

H.3.1

Guidelines for Amenity Zoning Applications

H.3.1.1

Where appropriate, applications for amenity zoning should propose a density level that does not exceed
the target density levels outlined in this Plan for the applicable Land Use Designation. For example, an
application in the Rural Neighbourhoods Designation should propose a density level no greater than 1
lot per 1.2 ha, as outlined in the policies for that Designation (See Policy B.2.5.2.3).

H.3.1.1

Where appropriate, applications for amenity zoning should propose a density level that does not exceed
the target density levels outlined in this Plan for the applicable Land Use Designation. For example, an
application in the Rural Neighbourhoods Designation should propose a density level no greater than 1
lot per 1.2 ha, as outlined in the policies for that Designation (See Policy B.2.5.2.3)

H.3.1.2

Applications for amenity zoning should propose that one of the eligible community amenities listed in Section
H.3.2 will be provided in exchange for the higher density level being requested.

H.3.1.3

Increased density may take the form of additional lots or additional dwelling units. The Local Trust
Committee should ensure the total number of additional dwelling units allowed in exchange for community
amenities on Salt Spring Island does not exceed 40. This maximum number of total additional dwelling
units should be reviewed each time that the OCP is reviewed.

H.3.1.4

It is intended that applications should be for relatively modest increases in density, consequently the Local
Trust Committee should not consider applications in which more than 10 additional dwelling units are
proposed in exchange for any one community amenity.

H.3.1.5

Amenity Zoning Applications should be consistent with other policies of this Plan.

H.3.1.6

Prior to approving any amenity zoning application, the Local Trust Committee should give consideration to
the appropriateness of the land for the increased density. The following factors should be considered where
relevant:
a.

environmental values are identified prior to site clearing and design.

b.

development is located away from areas with high environmental values, and natural buffers are
placed between the development site and sensitive features.

c.

development is concentrated in areas with lower environmental values.

d.

site plans protect biodiversity, clean air, and clean water.

e.

development is located away from areas that may be subject to erosion, flooding, wildfires, and
wildlife conflicts.

f.

the impacts of roads are minimized and development is located in proximity to and accessible to
existing services, constructed roads, and transit, and the development should have the potential to
contribute to reducing community dependence of travel by automobile

g.

the fragmentation of habitat is minimized.

h.

potable water quality is maintained and an adequate supply is available to support the permitted level
of development.

i.

air quality is maintained and energy efficient design, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change
adaption are considered.

j.

energy- and water-efficient development is designed to conserve natural resources.

k.

development minimizes waste, and manages waste in an environmentally sound manner.

l.

that the development would not compromise archaeological, First Nations cultural, historical, heritage
sites or significant or outstanding landscape features.

m.

that the development would be located away from community water system supply watersheds and
community well capture zones.

The Local Trust Committee should request that the applicant provide reports and other information
satisfying concerns that the Local Trust Committee considers relevant, including provision of a site plan that
shows how additional lots, building sites and accesses will be designed to minimize negative impacts. The
Local Trust Committee may consider the use of site-specific zoning, covenants, designation of development
permit areas, or a combination of tools to implement these criteria.
H.3.2

H.3.3

Guidelines for Amenity and Density Valuation

H.3.3.1

The appraised dollar value of the community amenity provided should not be less than 75% of the increase
in the value of the land attributable to the rezoning. The increase in the land value should be calculated as
the gross difference between the appraised value of the land before and after the rezoning. Costs
associated with the rezoning application, site preparation costs, and profit should not be deducted from the
calculation of the increase in the value of the land.

H.3.3.2

The appraised value of both the proposed community amenity and of the increased density should be
determined by means of a report provided by an independent professional appraiser, or other independent
qualified professional, selected by and reporting to the Local Trust Committee. The cost of the valuation
analysis should be borne by the applicant through the mechanism of a cost recovery agreement. Where
valuation of the proposed amenity or of the proposed increase in land value are complex or there may be
extraordinary costs, the Local Trust Committee may request that the applicant disclose financial information
related to the proposal to the appraiser or to Island Trust staff and the appraiser or Islands Trust staff may
enter into an agreement not to disclose confidential information.

H.3.3.3

Where the proposed community amenity includes areas of land and valuation of the amenity is difficult or
impractical, the Local Trust Committee may consider an alternative to undertaking financial appraisal of the
value of the amenity. In such instances, the Local Trust Committee may consider permitting a maximum of
one additional parcel or one additional dwelling unit for each parcel of dedicated land that is equal to the
base minimum average parcel size for the Land Use Designation where it is located. For example, if land in
the Uplands Designation is dedicated, a maximum of one density could be exchanged for each 8 ha
dedicated or protected.

H.3.4

Application Procedures

H.3.4.1

Applications to exchange higher density levels for community amenities should be considered by the
Local Trust Committee on a case-by-case basis upon application for rezoning by the landowner.

H.3.4.2

Detailed specifications of the community amenity to be provided are to be included in the rezoning
application.

H.3.4.3

Where a community amenity is to be provided to a third party for operation and maintenance, the application
should be accompanied by a written agreement from that party to accept and maintain the amenity for the
intended use. Covenants, housing agreements, or other tools should be used to ensure the amenity is used
as intended. Parties chosen to hold an amenity should be public bodies or well-established non-profit
groups with a mandate consistent with the amenity provided.

H.3.4.4

When a community amenity is provided in exchange for extra density, the amenity must be provided or
legally guaranteed at the time of adoption of the rezoning.

H.3.4.5

Community amenities provided in exchange for a higher level of density should be identified with a plaque
that outlines the nature of the amenity/density exchange. If the amenity is intended for public use, then the
hours of operation and the body responsible for operation and maintenance should also be identified.

H.3.4.6

The Local Trust Committee shall request that the applicant provide reports prepared by a qualified licensed
or registered professional satisfying any of the above concerns that the Local Trust Committee considers
relevant. The Local Trust Committee may consider requiring development information through adoption of a
development approval information bylaw.

APPENDIX 4 - TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL

H.4.1

Guidelines for Applications to Transfer Development Potential

The purpose of transfer of development potential is to allow for the consideration of applications that would result
in the transfer of development potential from environmentally sensitive areas, lands that are hazardous, or lands
that have cultural, historical, agricultural or landscape significance, while supporting the clustering of development
potential in areas more suitable for development.
Transfer of Development Potential, sometimes referred to as “Density Transfer”, is the ability to rezone land such that it
results in a reduction in development potential in one location and an increase in development potential in another, with
no overall, or net, increase in density. The development potential usually takes the form of lots or units and the
transfer is achieved by simultaneously changing the zoning on the “donor” and “receiver” parcels, or areas, to reflect
the changed subdivision potential or permitted number of units on each. Transfer of development potential may be
considered on a case-by-case basis, upon application for rezoning. The approval of a transfer of density through
rezoning should be conditional on compliance with the following policy guidelines. These guidelines do not predetermine a favourable outcome for any particular application.
H.4.1.1

Applications should propose a reduced development potential on property within a Development Potential
Donor Area. An increased development potential should be proposed on property within a Development
Potential Receiving Area (See Map 26). Applications could also be made to transfer development potential
within a Development Potential Receiving Area if such a transfer would achieve a community objective.

H.4.1.2

Applications should not propose a density level in a Development Potential Receiving Area that exceeds the
highest density level allowed in that Area, where base and higher densities are established

H.4.1.3

Generally, applications should demonstrate the overall unsuitability of the sending area for the zoned
development potential and the overall suitability of the proposed receiving area for an increase in
development potential. Priority should be given to applications which can demonstrate that a transfer of
development potential would result in preservation of sensitive ecosystems.

H.4.1.4

Property where the development potential is being decreased should be protected by one or more of the
following tools:
a.
Rezoning that allows a reduced level of development or only a public use, combined with a
conservation covenant on the land to be protected where there are environmentally sensitive areas.
b.
dedication to a public body or non-governmental conservation group.
c.
heritage designation as outlined in Section 967 of the Local Government Act.
d.
inclusion in the Agricultural Land Reserve.
e.
protection mechanisms developed in consultation with First Nations where there are sites of
significance to First Nations.

H.4.1.5

For every density transferred, the area of protected land in the Development Potential Donor Area should be
not less than the minimum average parcel size allowed by the zoning on the protected land.

H.4.1.6

When development potential is transferred, the uses and structures allowed on the new land parcels created
should be determined by the land use policies that apply to the proposed receiving area.

H.4.1.7

The Local Trust Committee should give consideration to the suitability of the receiving area for the
proposed level of development. The following criteria, as appropriate, should be used in assessing the
suitability of the land for development:
a.
b.
c.
d.

environmental values are identified prior to site clearing and design.
development is located away from areas with high environmental values, and natural buffers placed
between the development site and sensitive features.
development is concentrated in areas with lower environmental values.
site plans protect biodiversity, clean air, and clean water.

H.4.1.8

Preference will be given to applications that locate transferred density in such a way as to reduce reliance on
the private automobile, and address climate change mitigation and adaption.

H.4.1.9

Applications should be consistent with other policies in this Plan regarding rezoning.

H.4.1.10 Applications should be accompanied by a site plan that shows how the transferred density will be arranged
to reduce impacts on the surrounding neighbourhood.
H.4.1.11 Applications should not involve property outside the area covered by this Plan.
H.4.2

Application Procedures

H.4.2.1

Application is to be made for a rezoning that would simultaneously decrease the development potential on
one property while increasing the development potential on another.

H.4.2.2

Applications could involve either a single or separate owners of property in the Development Potential
Receiving Area and the Development Potential Donor Area. While the settlement of compensation, if any,
between the owners is a private matter, the Local Trust Committee may give consideration to the imputed
value of the development potential.

H.4.2.3

The Local Trust Committee shall request that the applicant provide reports prepared by a qualified licensed
or registered professional satisfying any of the above concerns that the Local Trust Committee considers
relevant. The Local Trust Committee may consider requiring development information through adoption of a
development approval information bylaw.
