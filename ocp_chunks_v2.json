As part of\nthe Islands Trust Area, planning for Salt Spring Island must consider and address the unique mandate of the\nIslands Trust. The Salt Spring Island Local Trust Area is one of 12 local trust areas and one Island\nMunicipality within the Islands Trust Area. Each Local Trust Committee has been provided with most of the\nland use planning authority of a regional district board."

We\nappreciate and accept our responsibility to be the stewards of our island home, to honour its past, care for its\npresent, and protect its future. We know that it is more important to leave a legacy than to leave an impact.\nWe also respect our island\u2019s human heritage \u2013 the First Nations peoples who lived in harmony with the land\nand sea, and whose traditional territory we inhabit, and the early Hawaiian, black and Japanese pioneers who\nlanded on these shores with little more than their cultures and their determination and turned them into a way\nof life. And we acknowledge the old island families, with their diverse origins, whose generations have served\nour community and moulded past into present.\nToday, we know that our island and its people face many challenges. Some of these are global, such as\nclimate change and diminishing fossil fuel supplies, both of which pose particular problems for island\ncommunities. Others are more local, like our aging population and the loss of socioeconomic diversity. The\navailability of housing to meet a wide variety of needs, and the supply of safe, potable water are also issues\nthat must be addressed. There are many others.\nWith our Official Community Plan, we lay out a vision focussed on a set of objectives and based on a\ncommitment to honour the natural integrity of the island, while striving to meet the basic needs of its\ninhabitants. We commit ourselves to leave the next generation with an environment and with opportunities at\nleast as secure as those that we ourselves have enjoyed.\n\nWe understand that social and economic development must be in harmony with our mandate. We accept that\nthere are limits to growth, limits to resources, and limits to the ability of our environment to absorb continued\ndevelopment. We recognize human impacts and understand that healthy societies depend on healthy\necosystems, and we will work to minimize our impacts and restore the land. Our need to protect the land\nmust also ensure its agricultural future, not only because agriculture is a traditional way of island life, but also\nbecause in a changing world it is imperative that we enhance the security of our supply of food.\nWe also look to secure the future of our community, to ensure that it remains rural and resident-centred, with\neconomic opportunities to support a broad range of people. We appreciate the extraordinary artistic and\ncreative talents among our residents. And we hope that the children who grow up here will not only find it a\nplace to remember but will always be proud to call it home.\nWe are an active, engaged, vibrant community, increasingly confident that through careful planning and the\nself-reliance and ingenuity of our population, we can solve many of our own problems. In an age of climate\nchange and carbon footprints, we must also learn to adapt and tread with small feet.\nThe Official Community Plan that follows begins with a wide range of community objectives. These are the\noverriding principles that give us guidance and direction. As a whole, this Plan offers a vision, charts a\ncourse, and aims high. It is as full of hope and aspiration as it is of limits and restraint. In it there is a path to\nfollow that can lead us where we want to be."

They indicate the types\nof land uses that could be allowed to take place in each designation by zoning bylaws. They also show the\nmaximum density of development that could be allowed. The following general objectives have been followed\nin establishing the locations and policies for the Land Use Designations.

All NSSWD licences have peak day limits, but only the most recent licences have annual\nlimits. A 2.0:1 peak day to average day ratio appears appropriate based on the past 5 years\nusage adjusted for meter wear and estimated losses from watermain leaks. With current\npeak day licenses totalling 1.443 mgd and a 2:1 peak/avg day ratio, the calculated annual\nlicence limit would be 263 MGY.\n2. Current demand is based on very dry summer years (like 2003), the total of customer meters\nplus a 5% allowance for customer meter wear, plus a 15% allowance for losses from\nwatermain leaks.\n3. Build-out demand is based on the June 30, 2006 Islands Trust Staff Report build-out\nprojection for development within NSSWD geographic boundaries permitted with current\nzoning. The demand estimate is on the same basis as current demand.\nNote: Within the North Salt Spring Waterworks District (NSSWD), the amount of development expected\nunder existing zoning is likely to require all of the water available under the NSSWD\u2019s current\nwater licences. There is no assurance at this time that NSSWD could obtain additional water\nlicenses. Also, NSSWD completed a supply-demand study in January 2007 and concluded that\nwith current climate St Mary Lake drawdown may be excessive during future major droughts if all\nlicensees were withdrawing water at their current licence limits. Climate change is expected to\nresult in increasing irrigation demand and may result in declining water supply. Service\nextensions from NSSWD and Capital Regional District waterworks may increasingly be needed\nfor supply replacement for north-island areas with failing or polluted groundwater supplies. The\nCapital Regional District is now conducting a study of the NSSWD water supply situation.\nTherefore, until such time as adequate water supply is assured, the target for zoning changes\nwithin the NSSWD\u2019s boundaries will be to achieve no net increase in water demand. Zoning\nproposals within the NSSWD\u2019s boundaries which would lead to an increase in water demand may\nbe considered, if they also propose other sources of water, conservation strategies, or other\nzoning changes that would offset any predicted increase in water demand.\n\nTABLE 2 \u2013 Salt Spring Island Water Systems (excluding NSSWD)\nCurrent Connections and Remaining Supply Capacity\nCommunity Water Water Current Build- Peak Annual\nSystem Source Demand Out Day Licence\n(MGY) Demand Licence (MGY)\n(MGY) (Gal)\nBeddis (CRD/NSSWD) St Mary 7.8 10 62,000 10*\nLake\nCedar Lane Wells 1.1 1.3\n(CRD/NSSWD)\nCedars of Tuam (CRD) Wells 0.5 0.5\nErskine Heights (NSSWD) Wells 0.7 5\nFernwood/North Beach St Mary 75,000 22.8\n(CRD) Lake (13.7)**\nFulford Harbour Lake 9.6 12*** 70,000 12.8*\n(CRD/NSSWD) Weston\nHarbour View Wells 0.5 0.5\nHighland (CRD) St Mary 114,000 27.7\nLake (20.8)**\nMaracaibo Estates Wells 2.2 3.6\nMount Belcher Wells 1.5 1.9\nReginald Hill Wells\nScott Point (NSSWD) Wells 1.5 1.6\nSwan Point Wells\nNotes: MGY \u2013 million Imperial gallons per year\n* No annual licence limit \u2013 limit as shown is an estimate based on the peak day limit and an estimated peak\nday/average day ratio of 2.0\n** Amount in brackets is estimated annual licence limit if the actual maximum day/average day ratio is 2.0 \u2013\nthe peak day limit will be reached at this ratio at this annual volume\n*** Build-out demand includes Fulford School\nNSSWD operates Beddis, Cedar Lane, Erskine Heights, Fulford Harbour, and Scott Point"

In the past, such development has changed natural patterns of stormwater\ndrainage and resulted in flooding or erosion of downslope properties.\nThis Development Permit Area is adjacent to land that is within the Agricultural Land Reserve or that has been\ntraditionally used for agricultural activities. The higher densities of development permitted in this Area could\nhave negative effects on nearby agricultural activities, if that development is not carefully managed. By paying\nattention to the design of development in this Area, the potential for on-going conflicts between agricultural\nactivities and higher density developments can be minimized.\n\nThis Development Permit Area also includes three properties outside of village areas that are currently zoned\nfor multifamily development. Objectives for the development of these properties are similar to those for village\nmultifamily zones."

Other policies in this Plan\ncould lead to more intensive development on existing general employment properties.\nOther policies and objectives of this Plan recognize the community's desire to retain a quiet, rural character\nin island neighbourhoods.\nDesign guidelines can reduce the potential conflicts between large new commercial and general employment\ndevelopment and neighbouring properties.\nSome properties in this Development Permit Area adjoin or drain into land that is in the Agricultural Land\nReserve or that has been traditionally used for agricultural activities. The higher densities of development\npermitted in this Area could have negative effects on nearby agricultural activities, if that development is not\ncarefully managed.

The development potential usually takes the form of lots or units and the\ntransfer is achieved by simultaneously changing the zoning on the \u201cdonor\u201d and \u201creceiver\u201d parcels, or areas, to reflect\nthe changed subdivision potential or permitted number of units on each. Transfer of development potential may be\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis, upon application for rezoning.
